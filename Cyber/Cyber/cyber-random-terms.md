CPU attack : Meltdown
Meltdown, the attempt to perform an illegal read of kernel memory triggers the page fault mechanism (by which the processor and operating system cooperate to determine which bit of physical memory a memory access corresponds to, or they crash the program if there's no such mapping)

ADS Alternate Data Streams - originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.

For instance: the command

"type c:\anyfile.exe > c:\winnt\system32\calc.exe:anyfile.exe"

will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS "anyfile.exe."

ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

File Fork - split up files into multiple parts, but the OS treats them as one file and will track the position of each relative part of the file. Also can be looked on as data sets hidden inside one file.

TTP Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (used by hackers)

SIEM = general term = Security Info and Event Mgt

Exfiltration = copy data out of system

OpenSSL Heartbleed is a vulnerability

EXPLOIT MODULE = TRY AND EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY

PAYLOAD = WHAT YOU DOWNLOAD TO A MACHINE THAT YOU FIND A VULNERABILITY ON

Discovery scanner eg Nmap : host/ip/port

Vulnerability scanner eg OpenVAS, Nessus, Nexpose

Exploit framework eg metasploit : launches specific attacks against specific known vulnerabilities

Banner Grabbing - getting info from welcome and login screens and http header info

Lua is a very fast scripting language

Footprint = Topology Discovery = FIND ALL HOST/IP ON NETWORK

Fingerprint = work out which software is running, and which version
is running, by using non-admin tools to query

Burner phone is a prepaid phone that is used and then binned
BurnerApp permits a temporary phone number to be created so that people don't know your real number. Can be disposed of instantly.

Pivot Point - point of weakness or access

[httrack.com](http://httrack.com/) - download full site to local; ensures all paths work locally

Droplet is a mini-virtual-private-server running on DigitalOcean hosting; set one up in a minute! Price $5 a month upwards.

SSL3.0 is no longer deemed to be secure (Minimum TLS1.1 required)
TLS1.1 and 1.2 are deemed secure
POODLE is vulnerability in SSL3.0


bulletproof ISP - no questions asked!!!
Google hacking - expert use of Google to find information
Google Dork - advanced google search string
Website Ripping = website copier
C2 = Command and Control = rogue control servers (located in enemy territory)
PIVOT POINT = POINT OF ACCESS (part which is being attacked)
APT Advanced Persistent Threat : INSTALL ONGOING TOOLS WHICH REMAIN
CSA+ control classes
CoA matrix
