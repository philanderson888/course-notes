## ADS Alternate Data Streams

embed one file into another 

(Windows version of MACOS Forking)

originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.

For instance: the command

“type c:.exe > c:32.exe:anyfile.exe”

will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS “anyfile.exe.”

ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

File Fork - split up files into multiple parts, but the OS treats them as one file and will track the position of each relative part of the file. Also can be looked on as data sets hidden inside one file.
