## Introduction

Framework = set of policies put in place.

Compliance is testing if an organisation is putting the required policies into effect






## ISO 27001

ISMS Info Security Management System

Provides risk management to keep systems secure





## NIST National Institute Standards Technology

*ITIL best practice, NIST guidance*

5 Core Functions - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

1. Identify (threats)

       Manage Assets
       Risk Assess
       Govern
       Business Environment
       Risk Strategy
                     
2. Protect
   
       Information Processes
       Access Control
       User Training 
       Data Security
       Maintenance

3. Detect
       Events
       Anomalies
       Continuous Monitoring

4. Respond
       Response Plan
       Comms
       Analysis
       Mitigate

5. Recover
       Recovery Plan
       Improve
       Comms

Implementation

       Partial, Risk Informed (Policies and procedures), Repeatable, Adaptive (continuous improvement)
       
Profiles

       Maximise productivity in expenditure by identifying 
       current and expected states, and investing to bring
       an organisation into an expected state

Secure By Default : out-of-the-box-security is turned on
                                          Design : programmers build with security in mind
                                          Deployment : info secure environment





## ITIL 

ITIL is a best practices framework

*ITIL best practice, NIST guidance*

- Service Strategy
- Service Design
- Service Transition
- Service Operation
- Service Improvement

       Where - LOCATION
       When - TIME

## NIST 800-137 Continuous Monitoring

1. Define strategy
2. Establish continuous monitoring

## Policies

Password policies

Account management policies

AUP Acceptable Use = Fair Use

Privacy Policy

Surveillance

Security assurance = monitor data comms to ensure no data theft

Monitor data eg email, telephone

Physical monitoring : CCTV, alcohol/drugs test

Data classification

Data retention policy

Short term : version control

RPO in backups : last point at which a backup was taken

RTO : Recovery Time Objective : goal (in time) to get system up and running after a fault/attack - less than MTD Max Tolerable Downtime

Personnel Policy / Training

Separation of duties

Job Rotation

SOP Standard Operating Procedures

Dual control : shared ownership of critical areas

least privilege

auditing : decisions are recorded

mandatory vacation

rotation of duties / job rotation

succession planning

Mitigate personnel vulnerabilities with training and also with multi-factor authentication
