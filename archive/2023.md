### 2023-04-08

I have got the bug again for programming - having been in this Roku job for a good while now, I have got my zest back for exploring other technologies and building websites of my own ....

Just reviewing and going over the sites that I have already in existence ...

Firstly wix sites which I built ages ago - just going through them all and seeing what I have ...

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk another beautiful ready-made site, love this one!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/mysite video editor website with good blog as well, like the fonts etc and simplity of this site - yes I like it!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/mysite/blog  video editor website with good blog as well, like the fonts etc and simplity of this site - yes I like it!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/my-site-1 another fine and simple ready-made website, good to go!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk-2 super basic skeleton, nothing here

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ideaftest01 interesting shopping site - an ok start, but it's a bit old fashioned and lacking in some things ... maybe erase this one!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ot-enables-u one of the first sites I ever built!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/consulting this was an interesting one for philanderson consulting !

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philipandersoncv2 here is one I could turn into an online CV!!!

#### reviewing payment methods and options for online shops

- Stripe YES
- Shoppy Possibly
- Shopify seems expensive at 5pm for basic and 19pm for normal plan
- Wix plans from 4 per month but sites with payment options start from 15/m which seems expensive
  - Â£22 plan to accept payments, seems a bit costly at present

##### next steps

we can review how to create a shopping cart in stripe ....

### nginx web server

building an nginx web server from scratch!!! 

using aws image just search for nginx ....

I chose this one which was amazon recommended

NGINX Plus App Protect - Amazon Linux 2 Developer AMI (HVM, v1.7), provided by F5, Inc.

i made sure it had open ports 80 and 22 

i connected with

```bash
ssh -i path-to-my-private-key.pem ec2-user@public-ip-of-machine
```

the nginx is already installed so we can check this with

```bash
yum update
yum upgrade
nginx -version
service nginx status
```

we can also start it with

```bash
nginx
```

and also 

```bash
systemctl stop/start/restart nginx
# or
service stop/start/restart nginx
```

we can also edit the html file with

```bash
cd /var/share/nginx/html/
chmod 777 index.html
vi index.html
```

editing and saving the file with (escape) :wq 

then your changes should be visible.

you can view the web server at http://public-ip-address and the nginx web server should be visible


## apache web server on aws suse linux

this time i'm going for apache on suse linux on ec2 aws instance.

after logging in i find this help page

https://www.simplified.guide/apache/install-on-suse

so I first run

```bash
cat /etc/os-releases
```

to identify the correct version of suse linux i am using (enterprise 15.5) so I can select the right option for the help 

I then run

```bash
sudo zypper refresh
```

and this updates the metadata for the repository to update all the software, like the google play store or equivalent for this distro

it takes ages to run, at least 5 minutes, so I guess there is a lot of data to download ...

but ... eventually ... all the repositories download, so that is good ...

next, to building the web server

I am using this tutorial for guidance

https://www.simplified.guide/apache/install-on-suse

install apache

```bash
sudo zypper install --no-confirm  apache2
```

no need to edit the config file but can check it anyway

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
```

check server is configured OK

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
# Syntax OK
```

restart the service to refresh changes

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

configure the service to restart after reboot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

edit our web page

```bash
sudo vi /srv/www/htdocs/index.html
```

check ownership and permissions are good

```bash
sudo chown --recursive wwwrun:wwwrun /srv/www/
```

we can now test the web server

1. from the server itself

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1
```

2. from our local machine

```bash
curl public-ip-address-of-machine
```

3. over http

```bash
http://public-ip-of-machine
```

## bun web server

this one was built using `bun.sh` and uses vuejs and the `vite` build system

https://bun.sh

This was a bit of an experiment to use `bun.sh` to build a web server ... the built in template went with several options and I liked vuejs which I love, and this one was using vite to build the site ... vite obviously indicating that it's fast to build!

the result can be seen at

https://github.com/philanderson888/nodejs/tree/master/projects/bun/bun01

it's not deployed yet but that will come later!  that part ran into problems so I've just stuck with the local version here ... :)
