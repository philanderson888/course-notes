I have got the bug again for programming - having been in this Roku job for a good while now, I have got my zest back for exploring other technologies and building websites of my own ....

Just reviewing and going over the sites that I have already in existence ...

Firstly wix sites which I built ages ago - just going through them all and seeing what I have ...

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk another beautiful ready-made site, love this one!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/mysite video editor website with good blog as well, like the fonts etc and simplity of this site - yes I like it!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/my-site-1 another fine and simple ready-made website, good to go!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk-2 super basic skeleton, nothing here

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ideaftest01 interesting shopping site - an ok start, but it's a bit old fashioned and lacking in some things ... maybe erase this one!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ot-enables-u one of the first sites I ever built!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/consulting this was an interesting one for philanderson consulting !

#### reviewing payment methods and options for online shops

- Stripe YES
- Shoppy Possibly
- Shopify seems expensive at 5pm for basic and 19pm for normal plan
- Wix plans from 4 per month but sites with payment options start from 15/m which seems expensive


##### next steps

we can review how to create a shopping cart in stripe ....
