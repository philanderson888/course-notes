ADS (hide within another file)
ADS Alternate Data Stream : can 'fork' a file into 2 parts and use this to effectively embed one file into another one
ADS Alternate Data Streams - originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.   For instance: the command   "type c:\anyfile.exe > c:\winnt\system32\calc.exe:anyfile.exe"   will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS "anyfile.exe."    ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream
