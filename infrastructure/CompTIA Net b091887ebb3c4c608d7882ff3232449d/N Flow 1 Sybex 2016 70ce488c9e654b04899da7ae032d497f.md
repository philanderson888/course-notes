Chapter 1 : Introduction To Networks

Topologies

```
Topology = layout

Physical Topology

	Can SEE / TOUCH it : ACTUALLY EXISTS

Logical Topology	

	Schematic eg electrical network diagram

Bus Network

	FIRST EVER NETWORK
					     Terminator
	||======================================||
		PC       PC       PC

	Care!  At end require a TERMINATOR to stop
	SIGNAL BOUNCE (Like water waves hitting 
				a harbour wall)
	BUS BREAKS ==> NOTHING CAN WORK!!

Ring Network
	Take bus and join end-to-end!!!
	Early LAN technology was called IBM Token Ring
		(not used any more)

	Very 'polite' : you need a TOKEN TO TRANSMIT 
		OTHERWISE YOU ARE SILENT

		== CSMA / CA  COLLISION AVOIDANCE

	Today we use RING NETWORKS FOR WAN TECHNOLOGY
		EG FIBER OPTIC 'SONET' RING
	RING BREAKS ==> NOTHING WORKS!!!
		(FIBER : 2 RINGS )

Star Network
	Central focus of network = SWITCH (48 PORT
		SWITCH)
	YOUR CONNECTION BREAKS : OTHERS UNAFFECTED
Mesh Network
	Join all NODES TOGETHER FOR REDUNDANCY

	NODE    ANY DEVICE ON NETWORK EG PHONE
	HOST    EG SERVER, CLIENT (WIN7) MACHINE
	REDUNDANCY  HAVING ABILITY TO COPE IF A COMPONENT
			FAILS

```

Network Types

```
WORKGROUP
	NO SERVER ON NETWORK : JUST 'PEER' MACHINES
	PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK EG WIN7 CLIENTS
	
DOMAIN
	CONTROLLING SERVER 
	WINDOWS ==> DC DOMAIN CONTROLLER
		ACTIVE DIRECTORY ((INSTALL WITH DCPROMO))

	ACTIVE DIRECTORY : ROCK SOLID SECURE (ENCRYPTION
	PROVIDED BY KERBEROS )

CLIENT/SERVER
	TEMPORARY NETWORK EG WHEN YOU LOG IN TO YOUR
		BANK. YOU THE CLIENT; BANK THE SERVER

NOTE : TORRENT DOWNLOADS ALSO CALLED PEER-TO-PEER
	ORIGINALLY : FTP FILE DOWNLOADS. CAN'T COPE
		AS JUST ONE SERVER!
	TORRENT DOWNLOAD : BREAK UP LARGE FILE INTO
		'SEEDS'.  DOWNLOAD SEEDS INDIVIDUALLY.
		YOU ALSO CAN BECOME SOURCE FOR OTHERS
		TO GET THIS SEED NOW.			
		EG UTORRENT (DON'T GO THERE!)

```

NETWORK COMPONENTS : SERVERS
EMAIL
FILE : STORAGE
DATABASE
MEDIA : AUDIO/VIDEO
AUTHENTICATION : ACTIVE DIRECTORY
WEB SERVER
WINDOWS : IIS : INTERNET INFORMATION SERVICES
LINUX : APACHE
PRINT SERVER

WAN
INTERNETWORK : INTERNET ==> FROM THIS WORD (MEANS
NETWORK OF NETWORKS)

```
WAN IS WHEN JOIN MULTIPLE LANS TOGETHER

LAN1====================================LAN2
CORK		VPN in TUNNEL MODE	DUBLIN		

PREVIOUSLY : DEDICATED LINE (LEASED LINE)

NOW : USE PUBLIC INTERNET AND CREATE A PERMANENT
	'VPN' ENCRYPTED CONNECTION OVER INTERNET

	VPN = VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK
		4 PROTOCOLS
		1) PPTP   POINT-TO-POINT TUNNELING
		2) L2TP   XP : LAYER2 TUNNELING (STRONG)
		3) SSTP   VISTA : SECURE SOCKETS (HTTPS
				PORT 443)
		4) IKEV2  WIN7 

WAN CONNECTIONS

	POINT-TO-POINT	: TRADITIONAL 
			- PHONE LINE
			- SERIAL LINE

		CLIENT : DIAL UP TO ISP 

	POINT-TO-MULTIPOINT : LARGE SCALE WAN PROVIDERS
		TO ENABLE ROUTING OF TRAFFIC

		ISP : LEASE ONE/MORE LINES FROM 
			TELCO PROVIDER ==> BACKBONE
			OF INTERNET

			ISP = INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER

	SERIAL LINE : ONE WIRE
	PARALLEL : MULTIPLE WIRES WORKING TOGETHER
		((ONLY SEE INSIDE CPU & MOTHERBOARD
			NOW))

```

BACKBONE : FASTEST PART OF A NETWORK : EG OPTICAL FIBERS
CONNECTING EUROPE TO USA UNDER THE SEA

SEGMENT : ONE PART OF A NETWORK

CHAPTER 2

OSI 7 LAYER MODEL

SPLITS NETWORK INTO 7 LAYERS

1 PHYSICAL
2 DATA LINK
3 NETWORK
4 TRANSPORT
5 SESSION
6 PRESENTATION
7 APPLICATION

PHYSICAL LAYER

DEALS WITH ANYTHING WE CAN TOUCH

```
JOB OF PHYSICAL LAYER : TRANSMIT PULSES OF ELECRICITY
	OR LIGHT ONTO NETWORK FOR OTHER DEVICES
	TO RECEIVE

MODULATION : ART OF CREATING A SIGNAL AND SENDING IT
	OUT

ENCODING : ARRANGING SIGNAL SO CAN BE UNDERSTOOD

PHYSICAL LAYER DEALS WITH CABLING

	COPPER

		TWISTED PAIR

			UTP UNSHIELDED : CHEAP PVC
				PLASTIC.  4 PAIRS 
				= 8 WIRES TOTAL.
				TWISTED PAIRS : 
				 REDUCE INTERFERENCE

			STP SHIELDED : RARE EXCEPT
			   EG BANK OF ENGLAND!

		COAX  
			ONE SOLID WIRE (CORE) WITH
			OUTER METAL SHIELDING

			ALL SIGNAL DOWN ONE WIRE!!! 
			(EG 500 TV CHANNELS!)
			==> 'MULTIPLEXING'

			THICKNET : 500M : RG8 : 10BASE5
				(BASE5==> 500M)
				 (10  ==> 10MBPS)
			THINNET  : 185M : RG58 : 10BASE2
				(BASE2==> 200M)
				==> TV CABLE OF TODAY
		PLENUM
			FIRE RATED CABLE : STOPS FIRE
			SPREADING TO NEXT BUILDING

	COPPER CONNECTORS

		RJ11 : TELEPHONE : 4 WIRES

		RJ45 : NETWORK : 8 WIRES

		BNC : COAX (TV SET TOP BOX)

		F-CONNECTOR (COAX)

		VAMPIRE 'TAP' : OLD : BITE INTO 	
			THICKNET CABLE

	FIBER CONNECTOR
		SC
		ST
		MT-RJ	
		FERRULE = STRONGEST
			(ANGULAR = MOST EFFICIENT)

	FIBER NETWORK

		MONOMODE : EXPENSIVE : 50KM
			PURE LASER LIGHT

		MULTIMODE : CHEAP : 2KM				
			CHEAP LED LIGHT

EXAM : DEVICES AT LAYER 1

	1) HUB : BROADCASTS EVERYTHING

	2) REPEATER : EXTENDS ETHERNET FROM 100M TO 
			200M

DCE : DATA COMMS EQUIPMENT  :  ISP OWNS
DTE : DATA TERMINAL EQUIPMENT : CUSTOMER OWNS

```

LAYER 2 : DATA LINK LAYER

```
OFFICIALLY SPLIT INTO TWO SUB-LAYERS 
		MAC LAYER
		LLC LOGICAL LINK CONTROL

MAC ADDRESS : UNIQUE IDENTIFIER ON LAN
	F0-DE-F1-43-AE-4E

	OUI = NAME OF COMPANY WHO MADE NETWORK CARD
		(FIRST HALF = F0-DE-F1)		

ETHERNET FRAME

	|CRC|   DATA     |  SOURCE MAC  | DEST MAC |
				6 BYTES	    6 BYTES

	<===============1500 BYTES MAX=============>

		(JUMBO ETHERNET 9000 BYTES MAX)

SWITCHING TABLE

	SWITCH BUILD AUTOMATICALLY : LIST OF ATTACHED
	DEVICES ON WHICH PORT
	
	PORT 1	: MAC  AABBCCDDEEFF
	... ETC

SWITCHING : JOIN TWO COMPUTERS WITH A 'VIRTUAL CIRCUIT'
		SO GET VERY FAST CONNECTION
	
VLAN : VIRTUAL LAN : SPLIT UP (REAL COMPUTERS) INTO
		(IMAGINARY) LANS USING SOFTWARE

	EG PC1,PC2,PC3 ==> VLAN01
	   PC4,PC5,PC6 ==> VLAN02	

```

NETWORK LAYER (LAYER 3)

```
LAYER 1 : PHYSICAL
LAYER 2 : LAN (MAC) ADDRESS ==> LOCAL ONLY!!!
LAYER 3 : GLOBAL ADDRESS = IP ADDRESS

	1.2.3.4
		4 'OCTETS' (EACH 'OCTET' HAS 8 BITS)

		8 BITS  00000000  (MIN = ZERO)
		        11111111  (MAX = 255)

	PRIVATE ADDRESS : VALID FOR USE ON LAN ONLY
		(FREE!)

		192.168.X.Y	
		172.16.X.Y-172.31.X.Y RANGE
		10.X.Y.Z
		
		169.254.X.Y APIPA ADDRESS 

			DHCP : GIVES OUT IP ADDRESS
			APIPA : GIVEN OUT WHEN DHCP
					IS BROKEN

	PUBLIC ADDRESS : PAID : GIVE ACCESS TO GLOBAL
		INTERNET

		EG PING GOOGLE.COM ==> 172.217.5.110

		VMWARE NETWORK HERE : WHATISMYIP???
			208.91.1.34

		Cost around £5 a month for a STATIC 
			IP ADDRESS

ROUTING
	
	ROUTING HAS 2 PARTS

	1) ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER AND GATHER INFO
		ON 'BEST' OR 'MOST EFFICIENT' ROUTES
		AROUND WORLD

	2) ROUTE / SEND IP TRAFFIC

	ROUTERS SHARE INFO : ROUTING 'PROTOCOL'

		PROTOCOL = LANGUAGE

		RIP
		EIGRP
		OSPF
		IGP
		EGP
		BGP

		RIP : SIMPLEST : JUST 'BROADCASTS'
		ALL DATA EVERY 30 SECONDS ((SUPER
		BASIC))

			ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL
				(RIP)

		DISTANCE MEASURED IN 'HOPS' FROM 
		1 ROUTER TO NEXT ((HOP COUNT == 			'METRIC'))
		
			PATHPING GOOGLE.COM
			TRACERT GOOGLE.COM

		Max Hop Count = TTL = Time To Live 
			~~ 30 hops 
	
		PATHPING  PING EACH ROUTER ON WAY
				TO FINAL DESTINATION
		TRACERT
			

	OTHER ROUTING PROTOCOLS

		EIGRP : CISCO : EFFICIENT : COUNTS HOPS
			BUT NO BROADCAST (UNICAST ONLY)

			BROADCAST => 1 TO ALL
			UNICAST  ==> 1 TO 1
			MULTICAST => 1 TO GROUP (PICTURE
 			  : LIKE WHATSAPP CHAT GROUP)
			  MULTICAST ADDRESS 139.X.Y.Z
			ANYCAST   => 1 TO NEAREST

		OSPF : USES GLOBAL 'AREAS' LIKE 
			CONTINENTS=>COUNTRY=>CITY=>
			NEIGHBOURHOOD=>STREET

```

LAYER 4 : TRANSPORT LAYER

```
LAYER 1 : PHYSICAL
LAYER 2 : DATA LINK : SWITCH : MAC ADDRESS
LAYER 3 : NETWORK   : ROUTER : IP ADDRESS

LAYER 4 : ADDS TRACKING FOR IP TRAFFIC - DID IT ARRIVE???

	TCP : TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

		Count packets out (Sequence  Number)
		and received (Acknowledgement number)

		Send 1,2,3,4,5  (sent out)
		Ack  1,2,       (received and 					acknowledged)
		Sender knows 3,4,5 gone missing 
			so resends
		
	3-WAY HANDSHAKE

		USED TO INITIATE ALL TCP CONNECTIONS
	syn	1) CLIENT : ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE?
	syn/ack	2) SERVER : YES
	ack	3) CLIENT : OK LET'S GO

	TCP FLOW CONTROL

		VARIABLE 'WINDOW' OR SIZE OF PACKETS
		SLOW NETWORK : SMALL PACKETS
		FAST NETWORK : LARGE PACKETS

	TCP PROVIDES A 'CONNECTION-ORIENTED' CONNECTION
		(WE CAN TRACK ALL PACKETS WITH A NUMBER)		
	UDP : IF WE DON'T NEED CHECKING WE CAN USE UDP
		USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
		JUST DOES NOT CHECK ANYTHING : DUMMY
			PROTOCOL!!!
		FAST EG USE FOR YOUTUBE STREAMING

SESSION LAYER
	CREATE AND TERMINATE 'SESSION' = FLOW OF DATA
	THINK : 5 YOUTUBE VIDEOS FLOWING TO 5 BROWSER
		TABS

PRESENTATION LAYER
	ENCRYPT DATA  :  NO LONGER 'PLAIN ENGLISH'
	COMPRESS DATA 
		EG RAW PHOTOGRAPH TO COMPRESSED JPG FILE
		EG WAV AUDIO TO COMPRESSED MP3 AUDIO		

APPLICATION LAYER
	PROGRAM WHICH REQUESTS ACCESS TO NETWORK EG
	OUTLOOK, SKYPE

```

IP Protocols

```
IP has a family of technologies all working together

IP 	: like a SECURE MEDIEVAL CASTLE : ZERO ACCESS
		UNLESS THROUGH AN APPROVED CHANNEL 
Port	65536 approved channels (2 to power 16)
		1-1000 main predefined
		1000+ free for people to use as wish
			eg gamers
Socket
	IP:Port = a socket

FTP File Transfer Protocol

	Port 20,21
	Original : came with the internet!
	Basic but works
	NOT SECURE!!!

	Job : download files

	Secure version
			1) SFTP over SSH port 22
			2) FTPS	over SSL port 443

Telnet 
	Port 23
	Came with the internet!!!
	Sends COMMANDS ACROSS THE INTERNET TO CONTROL
		ANOTHER MACHINE!!!

	POP : Receive SIMPLE VERSION : Port 110

	IMAP : Receive COMPLEX VERSION : Port 143

DNS : Domain Name System

	converts www.rte.ie to 104.16.40.72

	Port 53

DHCP : Give computer IP Address

	Port 67
	D Discover (broadcast) 'I need an IP'
	O Offer (Server says 'do you want this IP'?)
	R Request (Client formal request this IP)
	A Ack (server acknowledges)

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol

	Port 3389

	Remote control another computer

TFTP Trivial FTP : Copy files round a LAN

	Port 69

NetBIOS : using HOSTNAME as the NETWORK IDENTIFIER

	Hostname ==> NAME OF COMPUTER

	Port 137-139

```

Binary

```
Decimal 567 breaks down

	100	10	1
	5	6	7

	5 HUNDREDS + 6 TENS +  7 UNITS

Binary also breaks down eg 10101010

	... see Excel ...	

```

Chapter 3 : Network Cabling

Physical Media = cabling
Bounded Media = cabling
Unbounded Media ==> wireless solution eg WIFI / Satellite / Radio

Coax

	CAT 5		100mbps   FAST ETHERNET
	CAT 5e		1000mbps  GIGABIT (HALF DUPLEX)
	CAT 6		1000mbps  FULL DUPLEX

Note	
	Mb = bits / second  ((TRANSMIT DATA))
	MB = bytes          (STORE DATA eg 1TB)

SIMPLEX EG TV, RADIO IE 1 WAY ONLY
HALF DUPLEX : WALKIE TALKIE : ONE WAY AT TIME
FULL DUPLEX : TELEPHONE : 2 WAY COMMS

```

FIBER

ANGLED CONNECTOR (APC= ANGLED POLISHED)
	ANGLED CONNECTOR PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY
		OF THROUGHPUT
CONNECTOR TYPES : SC, ST, MT-RJ, FERRULE
	FERRULE = STRONGEST
		APC = ANGLED = BEST

```

FIBER IS IMMUNE TO INTERFERENCE

```
    INTERFERENCE TYPES:	

	STATIC 
	ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (EMI)
	RADIO FREQUENCY INFERFERENCE (RFI)
	
	FROM...
		ELECTRIC MOTORS, MICROWAVE OVEN

	USE ONE OR OTHER AND STICK TO IT!!!

STRAIGHT THROUGH
	CONNECTS DIFFERENT DEVICE
	EG PC TO SWITCH

	= STANDARD ETHERNET 
	= PATCH CABLE
	
CROSSOVER
	CONNECT SIMILAR DEVICES EG 2 SWITCHES
		OR 2 PCS
	PIN OUT ==> CROSS OVER TO PIN IN ON OTHER
			END

				RANDOM TIME **

```

TYPES OF WIRING

```
BASEBAND

	ONE SIGNAL DOWN ONE WIRE

BROADBAND

	MANY SIGNALS DOWN ONE WIRE

BIT RATE EG 10mbps

BAUD RATE : RARELY USED : OLDER MEASUREMENT OF SPEED

```

ETHERNET : COLLISION AND BROADCAST DOMAINS

```
COLLISION DOMAIN : ONLY AFFECTS COMPUTERS ON
	LOCAL 'SEGMENT'.  COLLISIONS BLOCKED BY SWITCH

<------------collision domain---------->

----------------------------------------
PC		PC		        SWITCH

BROADCAST DOMAIN : IS THE REGION THAT A BROADCAST
	WILL REACH TO

	<---------broadcast domain----->
	--------------------------------
	PC         SWITCH            ROUTER
					(block
				        broadcasts)

```

HEXADECIMAL

```
DECIMAL RUNS 0 THROUGH 9

HEX RUNS 0 THROUGH 9 THEN A,B,C,D,E,F 
		A=10 B=11 C=12 D=13 E=14 F=15

BINARY					HEX
8	4	2	1

0	0	0	0		0

EG 1000 BASE TX		T ==> TWISTED PAIR (ETHERNET)

   1000 BASE CX		C ==> COAX

   1000 BASE FX, SX, LX, SR, LR, ER...
			ALL OTHER LETTERS ==> GO FIBER!

```

ETHERNET OVER POWERLINE

```
==> DON'T USE ==> GETTING NETWORKING OVER MAINS!!!

((CAN GET PLUGS IN YOUR HOUSE TO TURN THIS ON
	WHICH DOES WORK - NO SETUP))

```

NIC
Network Interface Card
Flashing lights
green : power
orange : data (flickering when
data sent) (colours can
vary)

HUB
Layer 1 device
'dumb' device
'bits in' ==> just send out same data on all other
ports

```
	Slow 10Mbps
	Speed = 1/n    so 20 devices ==> 1/20 speed

	EXAM : HUB : ALWAYS WRONG ANSWER!!!

```

BRIDGE

```
CONNECT TWO NETWORKS WHICH ARE DISSIMILAR IN NATURE
	EG TOKEN RING TO ETHERNET

	Worse - possibly modifies it slightly

```

Session Hijack

```
Client------------Bad Router-----------Server

	Bad router 'pretends' to be one of
	the machines and cuts off communication.
	You end up talking to bad router thinking
	it's your real server

	 comms
Client<---------->Bad Router           Server

Certificates and PKI

```
There are THREE WAYS TO ENCRYPT DATA!!!

1) SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

2) ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

3) ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION, ALSO CALLED 'HASHING'

```

Symmetric Encryption

```
This uses ONE KEY to both ENCRYPT and DECRYPT data!

Plain text ===> ENCRYPT ==> Cipher text
					
	Encryption uses

		1) ALGORITHM (DOES NOT CHANGE)

		2) KEY (EG WIFI KEY) WHICH DOES
			CHANGE

WIFI is WEAK because ONE KEY DOING BOTH
	ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION : EASIER FOR
	ATTACKERS TO WORK OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING!

	(( SYMMETRIC KEY = PRE-SHARED KEY))

```

Hashing

```
sha1-online.com

Exam uses THREE HASHING PROTOCOLS

	MD5 OLDER BUT VALID
	SHA1 GOVERNMENT APPROVED
	RACE/RIPEMD  FOR TEXT

Hash looks like

	Phil ==> d14ffd41334ec4b4b3f2c0d55c38be6f

Hash can be used to do an INTEGRITY CHECK to 	
	ensure a file has not changed eg

	Phil.  (change by just one full stop)
	    ==>  dcd4936713c27cae72c65e90c1e60a66

WHERE DO WE USE HASHING?

1) PASSWORDS : DON'T STORE THEM BUT STORE HASH!
2) VERIFY FILE HAS NOT CHANGED (INTEGRITY)

SUBNETTING

```
Refresh : Class A  255.0.0.0
	  Class B  255.255.0.0
	  Class C  255.255.255.0

Let's focus on Class C

One Network 254 hosts (256-2)
Network ID 192.168.1.0
Broadcast ID 192.168.1.255
Host ID 192.168.1.1-254

```

Imagine standard masks do not give us enough 'finesse'
eg Want 2 NETWORKS WITH 100 COMPUTERS - HOW DO WE DO THIS???

```
We 'steal' one bit from the last 8 bits and use
it to make two networks

1)    0   0000000
2)    1   0000000

To 'steal' this bit we 'move' the subnet mask one
	place

255		255		255		128
binary
11111111	11111111	11111111   1 0000000

					 ^  ^
				        old new
				        split
					point

Result : create two networks
First network
Network ID = 192.168.1.0  (as before)
Broadcast ID = 192.168.1.127 (changed)
Host ID 192.168.1.1-126  (changed)    (128-2=126
				      computers)

Second network
The IP address range flows on from the previous
		network
Network ID = 192.168.1.128
Broadcast ID = 192.168.1.255 
Host ID 192.168.1.129-254     (128-2=126 hosts)

Binary
Network 1    0 0000000 through 0 1111111
  hosts run from 0 0000001 through 0 1111110

Network 2    1 0000000 through 1 1111111
  hosts run from 1 0000001 through 1 1111110

```

Let's make this a bit harder : split again so have 4 networks this time each with 64-2=62 computers in them

```
Mask is now /26 mask 
Written
(last octet only)   11  000000

From this create 4 networks
		    00  000000
		    01  000000
		    10  000000
		    11  000000
What is this in decimal???
		    0,64,128,192 are four network ids

Broadcast ID (highest in range) 
		    00  111111  etc

		63,127,191,255  four broadcast ids
			   (highest in each range)

So the broadcast ID of first network will be
	192.168.1.63 etc....
and network ID is 192.168.1.0, then
		  192.168.1.64 etc 

Second network 
	ID        .64
	HOST      .65 THROUGH .126
	BROADCAST .127

Third network
	ID        .128
	HOST      .129 THROUGH .190
	BROADCAST .191

Fourth network
	ID        .192
	HOST      .193 THROUGH .254
	BROADCAST .255

CRITICALS IN EXAM
	GIVEN MASK /26
	WORK OUT THAT MEANS XX  YYYYYY
		COMPUTERS BLOCKS OF 64
	NETWORK ID JUMP IN STEPS OF 64
	FOUR NETWORKS 0,64,128,192

	ID : 0  HOSTS 1-62  BROADCAST 63 (MAX)

```

LAST SUBNET /27

```
FIRST THING : CAN YOU WORK OUT THE 'NETWORK JUMP'?

NETWORK LOOKS LIKE 111 00000

	ie 8 networks and each network has 
		computers in blocks of 32

	If blocks of 32 then 256/32 means 8 networks

	why is this???  3 bits ==> 2 to power 3 = 8
	                5 bits ==> 2 to power 5 = 32

Challenge : write out blocks with Network ID,
	BroadcastID and Host ID range

	Network ID : 192.168.1.0
	Broadcast ID : 192.168.1.31
	Host range : 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.30

```

Second network
Net Id .32 -
broadcast. 63
Host Id. 33-62

3rd
Net Id 64
broadcast. 95
Host Id. 65-94

Last (8th)	Net Id 224
broadcast. 255
Host Id. 225-254

PKI
Summary of encryption so far
3 types
SYMMETRIC
ASYMMETRIC
HASHING
SYMMETRIC
weak
one key
eg WEP and WPA
FAST!
HASHING
strong
unhackable
one-way only though
verify 'integrity' that file has not changed
MD5
SHA1
Exam ==> RAINBOW TABLE is table of pre-
calculated hash values which crooks
use to work out your hash

ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
Rock solid technology
Rely on it for business : can verify a transaction
took place
Valid in court of law : judges will agree with
	whatever PKI says happened
Asymmetric encryption uses two keys

	1) Public
	2) Private

	One encrypts 
	Other decrypts
		(does not matter which way round)

Private - like ATM card - MUST BE KEPT SECURE SO
	ONLY  YOU HAVE ACCESS
Public - ANYONE CAN HAVE YOUR PUBLIC KEY!

Example : Phil sends David encrypted file (only for
		David to open)

	1) Phil get's David's PUBLIC KEY
	2) Phil ENCRYPT FILE using DAVID'S PUBLIC
		KEY
	3) Send to David 
	4) David UNLOCKS FILE with DAVID'S 
			PRIVATE KEY

PHIL		BAD GUY			DAVE
PUBLIC KEY				PRIVATE KEY
		ENCRYPTED 
		FILE
		((ONLY DAVE PRIVATE
		KEY CAN UNLOCK))

SIGNING A DOCUMENT 

	HOW CAN WE 'SIGN' A DOCUMENT SO IT'S 
	VALID IN A COURT OF LAW?

	1) TAKE OUR DOCUMENT
	2) HASH IT (MD5 OR SHA1)
	3) ENCRYPT HASH USING OUR PRIVATE KEY
		<<<this is the 'signing' bit>>

	FILE IS NOW 'SIGNED'

	COURT OF LAW : DECRYPT HASH WITH OUR
		PUBLIC KEY AND VERIFY HASH
		IS VALID 

PKI = COMPANY WHICH USES CERTIFICATE

```

Using Certificates

```
Certificates allow COMPUTERS TO TALK TO EACH 
	OTHER WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION

	EAP-TLS
		ALLOWS TWO COMPUTERS TO AUTHENTICATE
		EACH OTHER (MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION)
		AS LONG AS BOTH HAVE CERTIFICATES
		PRE-INSTALLED

		<< extensible authentication
			protocol / transport
			layer security >>

	PEAP PROTECTED EAP : CERTIFICATE ON SERVER 
		ONLY (USER INPUTS PASSWORD)

	LEAP LIGHTWEIGHT EAP : WEAK (NO 
		CERTIFICATES)

WAN CIRCUITS : CIRCUIT VS PACKET SWITCHING

```
CIRCUIT SWITCHED = DEDICATED LINE.  ALL DATA
	TAKES EXACTLY SAME PATH, ALWAYS!!!

	VIRTUAL CIRCUIT = DEDICATED PATH JUST
		FOR THIS PHONE CALL; ALL DATA	
		TAKES SAME ROUTE

PACKET SWITCHED : IP TRAFFIC : EACH PACKET
	TAKES IT'S OWN (UNIQUE) PATH ACROSS
	INTERNET	

```

ATM (602) Asynch Transfer Mode

```
Exam : quite old now but data send in
	FIXED SIZE OF 53 BYTES!!!

```

FRAME RELAY

```
Old
Creates 'virtual circuits' across internet
	Each 'virtual circuit' gets an ID
		DLCI (page 599)

```

FIBER OPTIC (585)

```
