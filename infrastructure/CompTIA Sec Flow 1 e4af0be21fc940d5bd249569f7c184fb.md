7 Layer OSI Model

1. Physical

    Job of physical layer is to actually pulse out electricity
    from your machine onto the network

    Cabling
    Ethernet
    UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair
    STP Shielded Twisted Pair
    RJ45
    COAX

    ```
     	RG58  (TV cable today) (Thinnet)

     	RG8   (original COAX 'Thicknet')

     	Connector : BNC connector
     		    F-connector

     Fiber
     	MonoMode : Expensive Pure Laser (50km)
     	Multimode : Cheap LED light (2km)

     	Connector : MT-RJ, ST, SC

    ```

    WIFI
    Sending signals using EM (electromagnetic) radiation

    DEVICES AT LAYER 1

    ```
     CABLES
     
     HUB : Primitive device which has no knowledge of 			packets etc.  Just electricity in and electricity 
     out.  
     	BAD : BROADCASTS ON ALL PORTS, ALL TRAFFIC
     			RECEIVED
     REPEATER
     	Extend Ethernet max distance (100m) eg
     		to 200m or even more

     	 ((5-4-3 rule : max of 5 repeaters))

    ```

Layer 2 : Data Link Layer

```
Uses MAC Address to SEND SIGNALS LOCALLY ON LAN
MAC ADDRESS  :  PHYSICAL ADDRESS 

	IPCONFIG /ALL

		30-85-A9-9A-6D-0C

	VALID ON LAN ONLY

	ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA AROUND OUR
		LAN, USING MAC ADDRESS OF EACH COMPUTER
		AS UNIQUE ID

		NOTE : ETHERNET FRAME = UNIT OF DATA

DEVICE WORKING AT THIS LAYER	

SWITCH

	UNLIKE THE HUB, THE SWITCH IS SUPER EFFICIENT

	HUB SPEEDS : MAX 10MBPS AND 1/n IF n DEVICES 
				CONNECTED
		     20 DEVICES : ONLY GET 1/20 OF 10MPBS!!!			
	SWITCH SPEEDS : NEARLY ALL DEVICES GET FULL SPEED
			OF SWITCH EG 100MBPS OR 1000MBPS

		(MBPS = MEGA BITS PER SECOND)

		((Does this by creating a 'virtual circuit'
			in switch for each connection))

	((Stacking Switches : use UPLINK or TRUNKING port
				to connect!!!))

LAYER 2 SUMMARY 
	LAN ONLY!
	SWITCHES USE MAC ADDRESS TO GET DATA ROUND LAN
	ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA 'FRAMES'

```

Layer 3 : Network Layer
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN
Layer 3 : Global Internet = WAN

```
IP address

	Two types : private and public

	Private IP
		EG 
			192.168.x.y
			172.16.x.y-172.31.x.y
			10.x.y.z

		ALSO    169.254.X.Y  (APIPA ADDRESS IF
					DHCP FAILS)	

		ALSO 	127.0.0.1  LOOPBACK IP TEST ADDRESS
				   (IS IP WORKING ON MY PC)			
			PING 127.0.0.1
			PING LOCALHOST
			PING ::1

		Private IP Addresses are FREE  but NOT
		VALID FOR USE ON THE INTERNET

	Public IP

		Use 'whatismyip' to find out your PUBLIC IP!

		Public IP addresses cost money around $5 a 
			month

		So : only buy one and allocate to our
			'Default Gateway'

		VALID FOR USE ON GLOBAL INTERNET TO GET 
		TRAFFIC FROM A TO B

Routing

	Routing enables data to be sent around the world

	Routers : share info amongst each other on routes

		Data shared using 'Routing Protocol' like
		RIP or OSPF to share BEST ROUTES with
		NEIGHBOURING ROUTERS

	Distance can be measured in 'hops' (1 hop is 
		1 router to next)

		or GEOGRAPHIC 'AREAS' SIMILAR TO POSTAL
		SERVICE WITH CONTINENT/COUNTRY/REGION/CITY/
		STREET/HOUSE NUMBER

		(( PATHPING

		   TRACERT  ))

```

Layer 4 : Transport

```
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN Ethernet Addressing
Layer 3 : IP Global Addressing

	Problem with Layer 3 is that no tracking is provided

	Packets are sent 'connection-less' and we have 
		no idea if they arrived or not.

TCP

	Has two fields to check and count all packets
	out and received

	1) SEQUENCE NUMBER = PACKETS SENT 1,2,3,4,5

	2) ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER = RECEIVER WILL SEND
		BACK A NOTE OF THE PACKETS WHICH DID 
		ARRIVE  ACK=1,2,4,5

	3) IF A PACKET IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THEN SENDER
		MAY RESEND

	TCP : SLOW BUT CERTAIN DELIVERY

UDP

	Provides no checking and may be used if just 
	speed is required, but no certainty of checking.

	eg using an internet radio station or youtube

```

Layer 5 : Session Layer

```
Coordinate streams of data being sent to the computer

	5 BROWSER TABS AND EACH ONE : PLAY SAME YOUTUBE 
			VIDEO ON EACH TAB!!!

		Organise data to stream to correct tab...

```

Layer 6 : Presentation Layer

```
ENCRYPTION
		Plain text => cipher text

COMPRESSION 

		EG BMP OR RAW IMAGE ==> Compressed JPG		
		   WMA              ==> Compressed MP3
		   WMV              ==> Compressed MP4

```

Layer 7 : Application Layer

```
Program which requests access onto network eg Skype, Outlook..

```

Binary

```
bit		1 or 0
byte		8 bits 10101010
nibble          4 bits 1101

```

Networking Protocols

FTP
Port 20/21
File Transfer Protocol
Secure??? NO NO NO! Passwords PLAIN TEXT!!!

```
SFTP	encrypt over SSH secure shell  Port 22
FTPS	encrypt over SSL               Port 443

```

Bittorrent

```
CARE CARE CARE!!!  VIRUS ALERT!!!

Takes a large file and splits it into 'seeds'.

	Each seed gets downloaded, but also if you enable
	it, your computer can now sent seeds to other
	computers which need it.

	==> DISTRIBUTED FILE SHARING

		(Much more efficient)

```

Telnet
Port 23
Earliest days of computing : control another computer
across internet using command line

```
	PLAIN TEXT : NOT SECURE

```

SSH Secure Shell
Port 22
Encrypted Telnet

Email
SEND
SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Port 25
Plain text : insecure by default

```
RECEIVE

	POP
		Port 110
		Simple version

	IMAP
		Port 143
		Complex version eg multiple email clients

```

HTTP
Plain text web page
Port 80

HTTPS
Encrypted web page
Port 443
Protocols to encrypt : SSL and TLS (newer version of SSL)

DNS
Domain Name System
Maps name to IP eg [bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk/) to 1.2.3.4
Port 53

DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Port 67
Allocate IP to computer

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol
Log in to server remotely
Port 3389

```
==> KNOW THOSE PORTS ABOVE!!!

```

ICMP : Error message protocol for internet eg 404 unreachable

```
PING : (echo request) member of ICMP family

```

SNMP : Simple Network Management Protocol
Manage network of many devices : routers, switches, printers,
servers.

```
	1) Heartbeat message 30/60secs : Know machine is 
					reachable

	2) States eg Throughput MB per hour

```

NETBIOS
Port 137
Used HOSTNAME to do NETWORKING (before DNS)

```
	PC01		1.2.3.4
	PC02		5.6.7.8

```

TFTP : Trivial FTP : Across LAN to copy eg new OS to CISCO SWITCH
Port 69

DMZ : De-Militarized Zone ==== PERMIMETER NETWORK

```
Used to host a public server eg WWW.myshop.com or similar.
Even if it does get hacked, minimum loss to organisation
as can't hack into secure LAN from there

```

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
Join two LANs securely using one of 4 encryption protocols

PPP : Create the dial up session (not encrypted)
	Point-to-point protocol : simply dials up and
				  creates the connection	

PPTP : Original Microsoft (not very secure)
	Point-to-point Tunneling Protocol
	PORT 1723

L2TP : Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
	Good, slow? from XP onwards...
	PORT 1701

SSTP : Uses Port 443 (HTTPS) which is already open
	(Secure Sockets Tunneling Protocol)

IKEV2 : Windows 7 onwards : has auto-reconnect if eg
		your wifi / 4g signal drops

```

VLAN
Virtual LAN

```
In order to keep departments separate we must create
VLANS which group SWITCH PORTS.

PORT		VLAN

1		VLAN01
2		VLAN01	
3		VLAN01       ports 1,2,3 can see each other

4		VLAN02
5		VLAN02
6		VLAN02	    ports 4,5,6 can see each other

EVERY PACKED GETS 'TAGGED' WITH THE VLANID ADDED
	TO EACH PACKET

```

Encryption (page 28)

```
CRYPTOGRAPHY = SCIENCE OF ENCRYPTION

ALGORITHM = PROGAM TO DO THE ENCRYPTION EG MD5/SHA1/RSA/AES ETC

KEY can be used by the ALGORITHM

PLAIN 
TEXT  ==> ALGORITHM  +  KEY  ==> CIPHER TEXT OUT
IN		

abc					d5d

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
USED A) WIFI
     B) WINDOWS NTFS ENCRYPTION!!!

WIFI

	ORIGINAL MESSAGE ==> ENCYPT WITH WPA2 USING AES
				ENCRYPTION + WIFI KEY

				==> ENCRYPTED MESSAGE (SEND)

	DECRYPT MESSAGE AT OTHER END USING AES + SAME WIFI KEY

	==> INSECURE AS SAME KEY BOTH ENCRYPT & DECRYPT SO 
			QUITE 'HACKABLE'

	EXAM : OLD WEP ENCRYPTION NO LONGER USED AS 'HACKED'
	       CURRENT 
			WPA USING TKIP ENCYRPTION JUST OK
			WPA2      AES                OK (GOOD)

	OLDER SYMMETRIC PROTOCOLS : DES/3DES/BLOW/TWOFISH

WINDOWS ENCRYPTION

	SAME THING BUT  

		==> YOUR PASSWORD IS THE KEY THIS TIME!!!

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION : SUMMARY : ONE KEY TO ENCRYPT AND 
			DECRYPT EG WIFI USING WPA2 & AES.

```

ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION = 'HASHING'

```
www.sha1-online.com

MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE UNHACKABLE IE CANNOT FIND 
	REVERSE PASSWORD 

	==> HACKERS RESORT TO USING 'RAINBOW TABLES' WHICH
		ARE PRE-COMPUTED TABLES OF KNOWN PASSWORDS

WHY USE HASHES??
	
HASHES CAN REPRESENT FILES OR STRINGS UNIQUELY

	STRING  ==>  HASH

	FILE    ==>  HASH    

			CHANGE INPUT THEN OUTPUT HASH WILL
			CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

	phil	e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

	phil + space  

		328368f5069ffc3dedd5b02e6347174e8aedeb22

```

PKI PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY ENCRYPTION

```
TWO KEYS ARE ISSUED

	PRIVATE (KEPT SECURE)

	PUBLIC (GIVEN TO ANYONE)

ENCRYPT WITH ONE ==> DECRYPT WITH OTHER (WORKS BOTH WAYS)

PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE AND ROCK SOLID => COURTS OF LAND
			WOULD ACCEPT AS EVIDENCE

THREE USES:

1)  ALICE SENDS BOB A FILE AND ONLY BOB TO READ FILE

	ALICE ENCRYPTS FILE WITH BOB'S PUBLIC KEY (ANYONE
			CAN GET HOLD OF)
	SEND TO BOB
	BOB USES HIS PRIVATE KEY TO UNLOCK AND READ

2) COMMAND HQ SENDS ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO ALL PERSONNEL.
	PEOPLE WANT TO VERIFY IT'S GENUINE.

	HQ WILL ENCRYPT WITH HQ PRIVATE KEY
	RECIPIENTS CAN UNLOCK WITH HQ PUBLIC KEY, THEREFORE
		CAN BE CONFIDENT IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM HQ
		AND NO-ONE ELSE

```

Chapter 1 : General Terms

Risk

```
Science of looking at all possibilities 

	Threat : to organisation

		Internal
		External
		Man-made
		Natural

	Vulnerability : can be exploited by attacker

	Risk : % chance (high/med/low) that a
		vulnerability in our system will
		be exploited

		POT HOLES IN ROAD

			SMALL ==> ZERO CHANCE OF CLAIM

			UNATTENDED .. POT WILL GROW

			CHANCE WILL GROW OF CLAIM 

			DO NOTHING : CERTAIN AT SOME
				POINT SOMEONE WILL CLAIM

Intrusion

Attack

```

CIA

```
CONFIDENTIALITY

	ENCRYPT DATA

INTEGRITY

	CAN TRUST THE DATA WE USE

	COURSE : INTEGRTITY ==> HASHING OF DATA AND FILES

		FILE1 ==> 'HASH' (MD5/SHA1) ==>
	
			FIXED LENGTH STRING WHICH 'REPRESENTS'
				FILE

			((CHECK HASH BEFORE AND AFTER))

AVAILABILITY

	DATA MUST BE AVAILABLE (TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
		SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY)

```

NON-REPUDIATION

```
CANNOT DENY ELECTRONICALLY THAT A TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE

WAY WE DO THIS IS A FOLLOWS : 

	1) GET YOUR FILES AND/OR LOGS OF TRANSACTION 

	2) PUT THEM TOGETHER AND ZIP INTO ONE UNIT

	3) TAKE HASH OF ZIP FILE

	4) USING PKI PRIVATE KEY, WE NOW ENCRYPT 
		ONLY THE HASH OF THE TRANSACTION

		(( THIS ENCRYPTED HASH OF A TRANSACTION IS
		   CALLED THE 'SIGNATURE' OF TRANSACTION))

		  UNIQUE !!!

	5) THIS IS 'ROCK SOLID' AND VERIFIABLE IN A COURT 
		OF LAW - BUT HOW???

		==> TAKE PUBLIC KEY OF SIGNATORY AND USE
		    THIS TO DECRYPT THE HASH.

		    TAKE ZIP FILE ==> GET FRESH HASH
		    COMPARE FRESH HASH WITH DECRYPTED HASH

			==> HASHES MUST MATCH

```

AUTHENTICATION

```
PROVIDE CREDENTIALS AND LOG IN

SOMETHING YOU KNOW : PASSWORD  /   PIN NUMBER

SOMETHING YOU HAVE : SMART / CAC / ATM CARD

SOMETHING YOU ARE  : FINGERPRINT/EYE/VOICE/RETINA

SOMEWHERE YOU ARE  : GEOLOCATION EG IP ADDRESS OR SATNAV
					COORDINATES

SOMETHING YOU DO   : WAY YOU TYPE (KEYSTOKE PATTERN)

```

AUTHORISATION

```
PERMISSIONS YOU RECEIVE AFTER LOGIN

NOTE : 

	FAT32 SMARTPHONE CARD ==> ZERO PERMISSIONS
	NTFS  WINDOWS : FINE PERMISSIONS TO GRANT/DENY ACCESS

MAC MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL

	BOOK : HIGH SECURITY DOCUMENTS (PERHAPS GOVERNMENT
		CLASSIFIED)

		EXAM : TRIGGER WORD : HIGHLY SECURE ....

		ACCESS IS ??? SET IN LAW ??? AND NOT
			NEGOTIABLE

DISCRETIONARY ACCESS

	DISCRETION ==> FREE TO CHOOSE

	WE CAN CREATE AND SET PERMISSIONS AS WE CHOOSE

	ACL ACCESS CONTROL LIST (( OF USERS WHO HAVE ACCESS ))

		ACE  ACCESS CONTROL ENTRY (( EXACT DETAIL
			OF PERMISSIONS THAT A USER IS
			GRANTED ))

	DACL = DISCRETIONARY ACL = ACL 

		ACL = LIST OF USERS ON AN OBJECT 

			(ACCESS CONTROL LIST)

		ACE = PERMISSIONS ENTRY FOR EACH USER

			(ACCESS CONTROL ENTRY)

		NTFS PERMISSIONS

			FULL CONTROL	SET PEMISSIONS
			MODIFY		CHANGE & DELETE
			EXECUTE		RUN .EXE / .MSI PROGRAM
			WRITE		CREATE NEW BUT NOT EDIT
			READ		VIEW
			LIST FOLDERS	VIEW FOLDER STRUCTURE

ROLE BASED ACCESS

	CREATE A ROLE IN YOUR COMPANY EG ENGINEER

		NEW ENGINEER JOINS : AUTO-ADD TO A 				PREDETERMINED LIST OF GROUPS
			DEPEND ON ROLE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL

RULE BASED ACCESS

	EG TIMED ACCESS MIDNIGHT TO 6 : RUNNING BACKUP
		SO ALL USERS BANNED REGARDLESS OF 
		PERMISSION

```

IMPLICIT DENY

```
ALL USERS ARE BLOCKED ACCESS UNLESS EXPLIT PERMISSION
				IS GRANTED	

```

LEAST PRIVILEGE

```
GRANT MINIMUM PERMISSIONS ONLY

```

SEPARATION OF DUTIES

```
CLEARLY DEFINED JOB ROLES AND DUTIES	

```

THREAT
IF ONE PERSON ONLY IS A 'SPECIALIST' THERE ARE TWO RISKS
A) INSIDER HACKING THAT NO-ONE KNOWS ABOUT
B) LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE IF THEY LEAVE

JOB ROTATION

```
EVERY 2/3 MONTHS MOVING INDIVIDUALS TO NEW JOB ROLE : 
	KEEP INFORMATION FRESH AND CURRENT AND WITH
	MULTIPLE PEOPLE

```

MANDATORY VACATION

```
FORCE TO TAKE HOLIDAY EG 1/2 WEEKS BLOCK AT A TIME

```

ORPHAN ACCOUNT

```
FOLDER CREATED BY USER THEN THAT USER IS DELETED!!!

NO OWNER!!!

```

PMI : PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

```
ORGANISATION WHICH TAKES SECURITY SERIOUSLY AND MANAGES
PERMISSIONS ACCORDINGLY

```

AUTHENTICATION

```
USER/PASS

SMART CARD  : HOLD 'TOKEN' OR 'KEY' OR 'PRIVATE KEY' OF
	A CERTIFICATE

	EG ATM, CAC CARD

BIOMETRIC

	FINGERPRINT/EYE SCAN=RETINA SCAN/VOICE RECOGNITION

GEOLOCATION

	GPS COORDINATES

	OR USE YOUR ROUTER'S PUBLIC IP ==> ISP LOCATION

		ISP INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER => PROVIDE
				INTERNET

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

	USE EG 1) USER/PASSWORD
	       2) SMART CARD
	       3) IP ADDRESS    TO LOG IN

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION

	SERVERS MUST AUTHENTICATE EACH OTHER!!!

	USE 'CERTIFICATES' AND 'DIGITALLY SIGNING' OUR
	CERTIFICATE TO PRESENT OUR CERTIFICATE TO THE
	OTHER SERVER FOR VERIFICATION.

		==> TRUST PROVIDER OF CERTIFICATE EG
			VERISIGN ==> THEN TRUST COMPUTER
			IS BONA-FIDE COMPUTER

	802.1X ==> PERMIT SERVERS TO AUTOMATICALLY 
		   AUTHENTICATE EACH OTHER IN BACKGROUND

```

CRYPTOGRAPHY = ENCRYPTION

```
WAYS TO ENCRYPT DATA

	STREAM CIPHER
	
		FAST BUT LESS SECURE!

		ONE CHARACTER ONLY GETS ENCRYPTED AT A TIME

			A  	=> 	Y
			B	=>	I
			C	=>	8

	BLOCK CIPHER		

		TAKES GROUP OF CHARACTERS EG 100 AT A TIME
		ENCRYPT THEM AS A BLOCK

		MUCH MORE SECURE, MUCH HARDER TO CRACK

		SLOWER!!!

SPEED OF ENCRYPTION

	SYMMETRIC

		FAST ==> CAN DO REAL-TIME

			WIFI
			SHORT-TERM 'SESSION' EG BANKING
				SESSION FOR 10 MINUTES			

	ASYMMETRIC

		ROCK-SOLID!
		VERY SLOW!!!

	HASHING : NOT REAL TIME EITHER 

```

STEGANOGRAPHY

```
HIDING ENCRYPTED DATA INSIDE EG IMAGE/MUSIC FILE/VIDEO FILE
SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT UNWANTED ATTENTION THAT THIS IS 
SENSITIVE DATA

```

OTP ONE TIME PAD

```
PASSWORD VALID FOR ONE TIME ONLY (EG TEXT CODE SENT TO YOUR
		PHONE)

TOTP  TIME-BASED OTP VALID FOR EG 10 MINUTES ONLY

```

HASHING

```
sha1-online.com

EXAM : ALGORITHMS USED

	1. MD5  (OLD)

	2. SHA1 (US GOVT APPROVED)

	3. RACE / RIPEMD  ==> SIMPLE TEXT-BASED HASHING

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
EXAM : TYPES USED

	AES : CURRENT, STRONG ENCRYPTION

	TKIP : OLDER, VISTA (WIFI)

	DES  : ORIGINAL , OLD NOW
	3DES : DES THREE TIMES OVER
	BLOW/TWO FISH

```

ASYMMETRIC TYPES

```
RSA 
DH   DIFFIE HELLMAN
ECC
DHE  : USING 'TEMPORARY' = 'EPHEMERAL' KEY

				TEMPORARY = EPHEMERAL

```

KEY EXCHANGE : SHARING KEYS BETWEEN USERS

DIGITAL SIGNATURE : FILE ==> 1) HASH FILE 2) ENCRYPT THE HASH USING
OUR PRIVATE KEY

```
	    OTHERS VERIFY BY DECRYPTING WITH OUR PUBLIC KEY
		AND COMPARING HASH OF FILE VS STATED HASH

```

SESSION KEY

```
SHORT TERM (FAST) SYMMETRIC KEY USED FOR REAL-TIME
	COMMUNICATIONS

	EG HTTPS COMMUNICATIONS

	
((PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY : CANNOT WORK OUT PREVIOUS
	SESSIONS IF CURRENT SESSION KEY GETS 
	REVEALED)))

```

SHORT PASSWORDS!!! ARE A BIG PROBLEM !!!

KEY STRETCHING ===> ADDING CHARACTERS TO A SHORT PASSWORD
AUTOMATICALLY TO MAKE IT MORE SECURE

```
BCRYPT USED FOR THIS

```

POLICY = WRITTEN AGREEMENT

```
LEGAL = LAW OF COUNTRY

WHAT 4 THINGS DO WE NEED TO CONNECT TO INTERNET???

	1. IP ADDRESS  
	2. SUBNET MASK 255.255.255.0	
	3. GATEWAY     (YOUR OWN PRIVATE ROUTER ON YOUR LAN)
	4. DNS

GATEWAY = COMPUTER ON OUR LAN THROUGH WHICH ALL INTERNET
		TRAFFIC MUST PASS

SINKHOLE ==> IN WIFI, SETTING UP FAKE GATEWAY SO 
	INTERNET TRAFFIC GOING THROUGH BOGUS GATEWAY

		EG HACK INTO DHCP ==> GET DHCP TO GIVE
			OUT A FAKE GATEWAY ADDRESS

WPS : ONE-BUTTON AUTO-SETUP OF HOME WIFI

	VULNERABILITY : 8-DIGIT PIN NUMBER USED TO SET UP

		BUT IT'S SPLIT INTO TWO 4-DIGIT NUMBERS

		   4 6 3 7   |   5 8 3 4

STORAGE TYPES

DAS DIRECT ATTACHED STORAGE

```
ANYTHING DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO YOUR COMPUTER

	EG SATA DRIVE / SCSI DRIVE / IDE DRIVE

```

NAS NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE

```
NAS DRIVE 

	USE FOR 'SOHO' SMALL-OFFICE HOME-OFFICE

			(LESS THAN 10 USERS)

	USING RAID 5 TO STORE FILES

		
		RAID 0 STRIPING : VERY FAST : BUT
			 PROBLEM IF ONE DRIVE FAILS YOU
			 LOSE ALL YOUR DATA
		RAID 1 MIRRORING OF 2 DRIVES 
		RAID 5 3+ DRIVES WITH FAULT TOLERANCE : 
			IF ONE DRIVE FAILS THE DATA IS
			ALREADY 'STRIPED' ACROSS OTHER
			DRIVES SO YOUR DATA IS SAFE

```

SAN STORAGE AREA NETWORK

```
USED BY LARGE COMPANIES TO STORE DATA USING FIBER OR 10GBPS
	COPPER LINES TO LIGHNING-FAST STORAGE NETWORK

LAN------FIBER SWITCH-------------SAN STORAGE AREA 10GBPS

```

CLUSTERING

```
SERVERA
	------------> SAN ----------> DATABASE FOR DATA
SERVERB

	SERVERA FAIL : AUTOMATIC SERVERB WILL TAKE OVER
		AND RESUME ALL SERVICES. CUSTOMER SHOULD
		NOT NOTICE!!!    FIX SERVERA AND FAIL BACK
		TO USING SERVERA AGAIN.

		SERVERA 'FAILOVER' TO B
		      B  FAILBACK  TO A   WHEN A FIXED

```

S/MIME

```
ENABLES MAPPING OF CORRECT PROGRAM TO RUN APPLICATIONS 
	INSIDE BROWSER

		EG PDF : GET CORRECT PDF READER

		   MP3 : GET CORRECT PLUG-IN TO PLAY FILE	

```

PGP PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY

```
EMAIL ENCRYPTION

```

HARDWARE ENCYPTION

```
HSM HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE

	DEDICATED DEVICE : ENCRYPTION ONLY (STORE
		PRIVATE ENCRYPTION KEYS SECURELY)		

```

NTFS ENCRYPTION

```
USED BY WINDOWS TO ENCRYPT FILES

LIMITED USE!!!

	CANNOT ENCRYPT
			1) WINDOWS

			2) PAGE FILE = SWAP FILE 
			             = VIRTUAL MEMORY

				SPILL-OVER WHEN RAM 
				GETS FULL			

			3) HIBERNATE 
				
				PUTS RAM CONTENTS TO 
				PERMANENT STORAGE
				AND SHUTS PC DOWN

```

BITLOCKER

```
PROVIDES FULL DRIVE ENCRYPTION, UNLIKE NTFS

PROBLEM!!!  OUR HARD DRIVES BOOT USING MBR MASTER
		BOOT RECORD TALKING TO BIOS/CMOS
		CHIPS ON OUR COMPUTER

		THESE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT UNDERSTAND 			ENCRYPTION!!!

SO TO GET BITLOCKER TO WORK WE MUST SPLIT OUR HARD DRIVE
		IN TWO

|  100MB   |      REST OF DRIVE			|
   PLAIN	  BITLOCKER ENCRYPTED
   TEXT

TPM CHIP  (TRUSTED PLATFORM MODULE)

	DEDICATED CHIP TO STORE BITLOCKER KEYS 

	
	(( IF NO TPM CHIP IS PRESENT, CAN STORE 
		BITLOCKER KEYS ON USB STICK ))

```

SQL DATA

```
STANDARD DATABASES STORE DATA IN ROWS AND COLUMNS LIKE EXCEL

	TABLE NAME

		ID	FIELD1	FIELD2

		1	JOE	BLOGGS
		2	JOHN	DOE

	CALLED A 'RELATIONAL' DATABASE = MYSQL/SQL
			
		MYSQL = FREE
		SQL   = PAID (MICROSOFT)
		ORACLE = PAID

```

BIG DATA / NO-SQL

```
TODAY SO MUCH INFORMATION GETS CREATED AND STORED THAT
TRADITIONAL 'RELATIONAL' DATABASES ARE TOO SLOW...

NEW BREED OF DATABASE - NO-SQL OR 'BIG-DATA' STORAGE

FIELDS LOOK LIKE

		{
			"ID" : "1"
			"NAME" : 'PHIL'	
		}

ISSUES WITH SECURITY : DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY : SECURITY,
	ENCRYPTION, PROTECTING DATA

```

DATA DISPOSAL

```
MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE RESTORED BY CROOKS IF WE DISPOSE
	OF IT CASUALLY.  STRICT POLICIES EXIST TO 
	ENFORCE CORRECT METHOD OF 'DISPOSING' OF DATA

1. WIPE OUR HARD DRIVE WITH RANDOM DATA 7 TIMES OVER

	(( THINK MUDDY FIELD : DRIVE 100 CARS ROUND 
		FIELD 10 MINUTES : ERASE ORIGINAL 
		TRACKS ))

2. DEGAUSS : TAKE A MAGNET AND WIPE DRIVE

3. PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION EG HAMMER OR PHYSICALLY SHRED DRIVE

```

HARDENING YOUR SERVER

```
HARDEN SERVER = INCREASE SECURITY

BASELINE = ORIGINAL SETTINGS

	HARDEN ==> CREATE NEW BASELINE FOR HARDENED SERVER

GET BASICS RIGHT

	UPDATES FOR SERVER : ON
	UPDATES FOR AV SOFTWARE : ON
	UPDATES FOR APPLICATIONS : PATCH MANAGEMENT : ON

```

INPUT VALIDATION

```
STOP 'COMMAND INJECTION' ATTACK   

	FORM  ==>   INJECT CODE EG <script>....code </script>

ERROR / EXCEPTION

	COMPUTER CRASHES : REVEAL SENSITIVE INFO EG
	 FILE NAMES AND PATHS ON ROOT SERVER

		ERROR: //c:\\windows\\system32\\thisfile.dll...
			 c:\\....to website....

	PROGRAMMER HAS TO 'HANDLE' EXCEPTIONS/ERRORS PROPERLY
		WITHOUT GIVING HACKERS EXTRA INFO

XSS : TRYING TO HACK FROM YOUR SITE TO NEIGHBOURING SITE
	(CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING)

XSRF : LOGGED IN ALREADY SO POSSIBLE POTENTIAL TO HACK 
		GREATER 

```

TESTING YOUR SYSTEM

```
BLACK BOX TESTING : JUST LOOK AT INPUT / OUTPUT ONLY
		(NOT DETAILS OF INSIDE CODING)

WHITE BOX TESTING  : KNOWING CODE INSIDE, TRYING TO 						TO BREAK IT DELIBERATELY

UNIT TESTING : ONE SMALL BLOCK OF CODE

INTEGRATION/SYSTEM TESTING : TESTING THE BIG PICTURE

ALPHA TEST : INITIAL RELEASE TO CHOSEN INDIVIDUALS FOR TESTING
	EG JOURNALISTS, DEDICATED AUDIENCE

BETA TEST : FINAL RELEASE, FREE, SO PEOPLE CAN TEST IT FOR 
		YOU (THEY GET FREE GAME!) 

FUZZ TEST : THROW RANDOM DATA AT APPLICATION : DOES IT
		WITHSTAND AND SURVIVE ???

```

PROXY SERVER

```
USED IN BIG COMPANIES FOR MANY REASONS : 

1) SECURITY : USING DIFFERENT IP THAN REAL GATEWAY

2) CACHING : SPEED OF DATA : STORE COPIES OF FILES ETC
			ON LOCAL LAN PROXY SERVER. 
			CLIENTS GET FASTER ACCESS

3) FILTERING : WHITELIST (GOOD SITES) /BLACKLIST (BLOCKED
			SITES)

4) USER ACTIVITY : KNOW WHICH USERS ONLINE, HOW LONG, WHICH
			SITES...BILLING PURPOSES...

```

TCP TRUSTED COMPUTING BASE

```
OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE 'HARDENED' OR LOCKED DOWN

```

FIREWALL

```
FIREWALL : JOB IS TO BLOCK OR PASS TRAFFIC BASED ON
	IP OR PORT INFORMATION

CONNECTION-LESS FIREWALL  (LAYER 3)

	CONNECTION-LESS DATA HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF FLOW
	OF DATA BEFORE OR AFTER

CONNECTION-ORIENTED FIREWALL  (LAYER 4)

	TCP : CHECKS FLOW

	CONNECTION-ORIENTED : AWARE OF FLOW OF DATA

APPLICATION-LEVEL FIREWALL  (LAYER 7)

	DEEP PACKET INSPECTION : LOOKING IN DETAIL
	AT CONTENTS OF PACKETS...

		EG INSIDE ZIP FILES ALSO

	(( WEB APPLICATION GATEWAY ))

MOBILE SECURITY

```
MOBILE SECURITY IS A 'HOT' ISSUE - WHY???

BYOD : BRING OWN DEVICE : PEOPLE USING PERSONAL DEVICES
	TO GET WORK DONE

	SECURITY RISK WITH COMPANY SENSITIVE INFO ON DEVICE
	WHICH IS 

	A) PERSONALLY OWNED
	B) NOT LOCKED DOWN
	C) NO CONTROL OVER OTHER APPS INSTALLED, IF THEY	
		ARE SNOOPING ETC
	

SOLUTION : ???

	ONE SOLUTION IS TO ONLY PERMIT 'REMOTE-DESKTOP' OR
	CITRIX-STYLE ACCESS WHERE PHONE JUST A 'WINDOW' TO
	REMOTE SERVER, NO DATA STORED ON MOBILE DEVICE

REMOTE LOCK

REMOTE WIPE

ON-BOARDING : HIRE EMPLOYEE : GIVE CORRECT TRAINING
			      POLICIES SIGNED

FIND-MY-DEVICE IF LOST

OFF-BOARDING : WIPE DEVICE SECURELY TO ERASE ALL DATA
		(EMPLOYEE LEAVE ORGANISATION)

	PATTERNS OVER A NETWORK

BEHAVIOUR BASED SCANNING

	PATTERNS IN NETWORK TRAFFIC OR 'RULES' GOVERNING
	EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR : ALERTS IF TRAFFIC BREAKS
	SOME 'EXPECTED RULES'

		** PRONE TO FALSE POSITIVE **

		FALSE POSITIVE = TAKING A GOOD FILE AND
				MARKING IT AS A VIRUS

CLIENT => DIAL IN => RAS SERVER
		     (VPN SERVER)

			==> AUTHENTIATE WITH RADIUS SERVER
				(TALK TO ACTIVE DIRECTORY)

			==> HEALTH CHECK VIA NAC NETWORK
				ACCESS CONTROL

```

VIRTUALIZATION

```
RUNNING ONE OR MORE SERVERS FROM A LARGER 'VIRTUAL HOST'

GOOD

	IF YOU ARE LOW ON CPU, RAM, HARD DRIVE OR 
		NETWORK THROUGHPUT THEN YOU CAN 
		DYNAMICALLY UPGRADE THEM AS YOU NEED				
	CREATE 'SANDBOX' ENVIRONMENT FOR SECURE TESTING
	
	CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SERVER OS/BACKUPS ETC
	IN HANDS OF EXPERTS

	NO LONGER REQUIRE PHYSICAL SPACE TO RUN SERVER
		ROOMS ETC

BAD

	TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON INTERNET CONNECTION...

	UNSUITABLE FOR LARGE FILE MANIPULATION EG HUGE
	VIDEOS DOWN LAN WIRE

	COSTLY $$$ JUST TO HOST A SERVER FOR YOU...!!!

```

CLOUD MODELS

```
SAAS              

	SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE

	LOG IN AND USE EG BANKING/FACEBOOK OTHER SERVICE
			ONLINE

PAAS

	PLATFORM AS A SERVICE

	GIVEN A VIRTUAL DESKTOP UPON WHICH YOU CAN INSTALL
	YOUR APPS EG OFFICE AND REACH YOUR APPS FROM
	ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD

	EG 'HOTDESKING' WHERE PERSON ARRIVES FOR WORK,
	ALLOCATED A DESK, LOG IN ==> SAME VIRTUAL DESKTOP
		WHICH THEY HAD YESTERDAY

IAAS

	INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE

	START OUT WITH ZERO.  

	BUILD - VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE EG SERVERS,
		SWITCHES, NETWORKS, STORAGE ETC
		
		MOST EXPENSIVE BUT MOST VERSATILE

```

CLOUD TYPES

```
PUBLIC

	SHARE HOSTING SPACE WITH MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS

PRIVATE

	YOU PAY FOR A DEDICATED SERVER WHICH YOU, AND 
	YOU ALONE, USE.

COMMUNITY

	PRIVATE SERVER SHARED AMONGST EG 3 COMPANIES WHO
	WANT TO WORK ON A PROJECT TOGETHER

```

CAT5E		1000 MBPS (GIGABIT CABLE)
CAT6		10 GBPS

```

SITE SURVEY : MARKING COVERAGE OF WIFI POINTS

```
EXAM : ENSURE WIFI NOT GOING TOO FAR OUTSIDE BUILDING

```

ACTIVE DIRECTORY

```
ACTIVE DIRECTORY IS BUILT ON A SPECIAL PROTOCOL CALLED

LDAP = LIGHTWEIGHT DIRECTORY ACCESS PROTOCOL.  THIS ALSO
	BUILDS LINUX PROGRAMS, NOT JUST WINDOWS.

	LDAP BUILDS THE STRUCTURE FOR ACTIVE DIRECTORY

LDAPS = SECURE VERSION

KERBEROS = USED TO PROVIDE ENCRYPTION FOR ACTIVE DIRECTORY
	(ROCK SOLID GRADE ENCRYPTION)

```

VPN PROTOCOLS (REVISION)

```
PPP	POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL; CREATES THE DIAL-UP CONNECTION

PPTP	POINT-TO-POINT TUNNELING : FIRST AND LEAST SECURE
	OF VPN PROTOCOLS  (PORT 1723)

L2TP	LAYER 2 TUNNELING : SECURE FROM XP ONWARDS; A LITTLE
	SLOW NOW          (PORT 1701)

SSTP	SECURE SOCKETS TUNNELING : PORT 443 WHICH IS ALREADY
	OPEN (HTTPS)

IKEV2	MOST RECENT (WIN 7 ONWARDS) : VPN RECONNECT IF WIFI
	OR 4G SIGNAL DROPS OUT

```

INSECURE AUTHENTICATION

```
PAP	PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL : PLAIN TEXT 
	SO DON'T USE!

CHAP	EARLY AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL USING MD5 SO NOT
	VERY SECURE.  DON'T USE.

```

SECURE AUTHENTICATION

```
MS-CHAP2	CURRENT VERSION OF CHAP

EAP-TLS 	AUTHENTICATION USING CERTIFICATES

PEAP		PROTECTED EAP 

LEAP		LIGHTWEIGHT EAP

```

ONE-TIME PASSWORDS

```
OTP	ONE TIME PASSWORD TO PHONE

TOTP	TIME-BASED FOR EG 10 MINUTES

HOTP	HASH-BASED WHICH VERIFY HASH ALSO ON TOP : CAN
	BE USED TO ENSURE AUTHENTICATION REQUEST IS
	GENUINE

```

EMAIL ENCYRYPT/AUTHENTICATE

```
PGP PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY

```

DIAL-IN AUTHENTICATION

```
RADIUS

	VPN CLIENT -> DIALS UP -> RAS (DIAL-IN) VPN SERVER

		--> TALKS TO RADIUS SERVER
		--> TALKS TO ACTIVE DIRECTORY TO AUTHENTICATE

DIAMETER

	DIAMETER IS TWICE AS STRONG AS RADIUS (PUN ON WORDS
		AS DIAMETER IS TWICE AS LONG AS RADIUS OF
		ANY CIRCLE)

TACACS+

	PROVIDES A GREATER DEGREE OF ENCRYPTION OVER THE
	WHOLE AUTHENTICATION PROCESS.  ALSO ALLOWS 
	MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

```

SINGLE-SIGN-ON LOGIN

```
SSO = ONE LOGIN TO MULTIPLE SITES

	<< SAML = USED TO PASS INFO BETWEEN SITES >>

		SAML = SECURITY ASSOCIATION MARKUP LANGUAGE

```

MULTIPLE COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER

```
FEDERATION = A GROUP OF UNRELATED COMPANIES WORKING
	TOGETHER ON A PROJECT.  NEED TO SECURELY SHARE
	INFORMATION.

INTRANET = INTERNAL WEBSITE FOR INTERNAL EMPLOYEES

EXTRANET = PROVIDE AUTHENTICATION AND HAVE YOUR BUSINESS
	   PARTNERS LOG IN AND YOU SHARE COMPANY

CREATING YOUR OWN CERTIFICATES IN A PKI INFRASTRUCTURE

```
PUBLIC CERTIFICATES

	VALID FOR USE ON THE INTERNET 

	ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN VIEW YOUR PUBLIC CERTIFICATE
	AND VERIFY YOU AND THE COMPANY EG VERISIGN WHICH
	ISSUED YOUR CERTIFICATE

	COST MONEY EG $300

	REQUIRED FOR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS EG PUBLIC HTTPS://
	WEB SITE

PRIVATE CERTIFICATE

	GENERATED BY YOU ON A FREE WINDOWS SERVER

	INSTALL 'CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY' (CA) ROLE

	==> ISSUE CERTIFICATES INTERNALLY 

	((YOUR PRIVATE CERTIFCATES NOT VALID FOR USE
	ON INTERNET))  ==> OTHERS 'NOT TRUSTED'
			CERTIFICATE MESSAGE

CREATING A PRIVATE PKI FOR YOUR OWN COMPANY

	1. INSTALL 'ROOT' (FIRST) CA (CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY)
			MACHINE

	2. IF YOU HAVE A BIG COMPANY, INSTALL SUBORDINATE
		CA MACHINES (ALSO CALL THEM 'ISSUING'
		SERVERS

	3. CLIENTS CAN NOW 'ENROL' OR 'REQUEST' CERTIFICATES
		FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES

		AUTO-ENROL MEANS COMPUTER CAN AUTOMATICALLY
		APPROVE AND ISSUE CERTIFICATES

		MANUAL ENROL : HUMAN BEING HAVE TO MANUALLY
			APPROVE REQUESTS

REVOKING A CERTIFICATE

	MUST BE ABLE TO PROVE A CERTIFICATE IS STILL VALID

	ON SERVER, CAN 'REVOKE' (NULLIFY) ANY CERTIFICATE

	PROVE TO CLIENTS THAT THEIR CERTIFICATE IS STILL GOOD

	TWO LISTS

	1)  CRL CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LIST : FULL LIST OF
		ALL 'REVOKED' (NULLIFIED) CERTIFICATES

		DELTA CRL : PARTIAL (UP-TO-DATE) LIST

	2)  ONLINE WEBSITE : OCSP (ONLINE CERTIFICATE
				   STATUS PROTOCOL)

		CHECK FOR JUST ONE CERTIFICATE : IS IT VALID?

BACK UP CERTIFICATES

	RECOVERY AGENT : AUTHORISED ADMINISTRATOR WHO
		CAN RECOVER KEYS FOR USERS/COMPUTERS
		IF NECESSARY

			((WITHIN ACTIVE DIRECTORY))

	ESCROW = TRUSTED 3RD PARTY TO HOLD OUR CERTIFICATES

	B) RESET BIT TO ZERO FOR ALL BACKED-UP FILES		

ARCHIVE (BACKUP) BIT

	SET TO ZERO WHEN NO CHANGES MADE
	SET TO 1    AS SOON AS ANY CHANGE MADE TO A FILE

INCREMENTAL BACKUP

	MON : BACK UP MONDAY FILES & RESET BIT
	TUE : BACK UP TUES   FILES & RESET BIT
	WED : BACK UP WED    FILES & RESET BIT

		PROBLEM : CRASH THURSDAY MORNING.
		RECOVERY REQUIRES 4 TAPES
		1) FRIDAY FULL 2) MON 3) TUES 4) WED
		==> LONG TIME TO RECOVER

DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP

	MON : BACK UP MONDAY FILE ((( DON'T CHANGE BIT )))
	TUE : BACK UP MON & TUE FILES (DON'T RESET BIT)
	WED : BACK UP MON/TUE/WED FILES (DON'T RESET BIT)

		CRASH THURSDAY MORNING: 
		RECOVER WITH 2 TAPES

Risk

```
Risk Analysis Process

	1. IDENTIFY YOUR ASSETS

		Equipment of value
		Data ==> OF HIGHEST VALUE EVEN THOUGH
			MAYBE CAN'T PUT PRICE ON IT!
		People 
			Knowledge and Experience of 
			key personnel
		Building

	   EXAM : AV ==> ASSET VALUE
	
	2. Identify Vulnerabilities / Weaknesses

	3. Identify Threats (Internal/External/Man-made/
				Natural)

	4. Probability Chart 

		% likelihood that a particuar threat
			will materialise and threaten
			a vulnerability

			eg 10% chance pothole x in road y
			       will generate an insurance
			       claim

		SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY

			$$$COST OF ONE OCCURRENCE		

		ARO ANNUAL RATE OF OCCURRENCE

			PREDICTED NUMBER OF TIMES A YEAR
			THIS WILL HAPPEN

		ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY

			$$$EXPECTED LOSSES IN 1 YEAR				

	5. IMPACT ANALYSIS : LOOKING AT COSTS ABOVE OR
		OTHER EVENTS WHICH CAN'T BE MEASURED
		WITH MONEY EG LOSS OF MORALE, MOTIVATION,
		LOSS OF FACE, LOSS OF REPUTATION ETC ...
	

	6. WHAT DO WE DO??? 

		NOTHING  IE LIVE WITH RISK (EG CROSSING ROAD)
	
		INSURE (TRANSFER) OUR RISK BY INSURING
			AGAINST LOSS EG FOOTBALLER INSURE
					LEG

		PUT UP WARNING SIGNS AS DETERRENCE TO 
			ATTACKERS : PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
		
		AVOID THE RISK ALTOGETHER BY DOING SOMETHING
			ELSE (DON'T CROSS THE ROAD BUT USE
				THE TUNNEL!)

		SPEND SOME MONEY OR TAKE ACTION

			"MITIGATION" => TAKE ACTION TO 
					MINIMISE OUR LOSS

			EG CREATE POLICIES, BUILD DEFENCES,
			   EDUCATE USERS, ADVICE FROM EXPERTS,
			   TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST
			   POTENTIAL ATTACKER
			   
			   
ATTACK SURFACE ==> SOMETHING IN WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED TO 
			A THREAT

HONEYPOT

	DECOY TO DISTRACT ATTACKER 1) THEY ARE DISTRACTED
				   2) WE CAN PERHAPS MONITOR
					  THEM
HONEYNET

	WHOLE NETWORK OF DISTRACTION

```

Scanning for vulnerabilities

```
Enemy may do the following : 

	Footprinting : use common sense methods to try and
			gain info on you.  Using methods
			which may be legal eg public 
			birth/death/marriage records, 
			public accounts records, website info

	Enumerating : Using illegal methods to gain further
		      detailed info about you.

		      EG  COMPANY : DOING PORT SCANS, 
			   HACKING IN AND GETTING NETWORK INFO,
			   IP INFO, PORT INFO, SERVER NAME 
			   INFO, NAMES OF KEY PEOPLE WHO
	
			Personal level : credit card info,
				security answers to questions

You may do the following

	Vulnerability Scan

	Port scan

	Deep-level test to try and penetrate your network
			eg using ethical hackers etc

```

	DATA LOSS PREVENTION : DATA TAKEN (STOLEN AND REMOVED)

	DATA LEAK PREVENTION : COPY TAKEN 

```

pressing on two separate buttons

FAILSECURE

```
POWER GOES OUT : SECURE LOCKED DOOR : REMAIN LOCKED BUT
	IF PERSON TRAPPED INSIDE THEY STILL CAN FORCE
	THE DOOR OPEN AND GET OPEN

	EG SERVER ROOM / SAFE

```

		OF UNCERTAINTY
	   FIRST RESPONDER : EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

```

FIGHTING CRIME : FORENSICS

```
IT IS IMPORTANT IN A COURT OF LAW THAT EVIDENCE IS 
	ADMISSIBLE.  IF NOT, IT CANNOT BE USED
	AGAINST A DEFENDANT	

INVESTIGATING A CRIME

	1. LOOK AT ANYTHING 'VOLATILE'  <<VOLATILITY>>

		TURN OFF ==> INFO DISAPPEARS

		EG  CONTENTS OF RAM OR PAGE FILES ETC

	2. HARD DRIVE : TAKE IMAGE STRAIGHT AWAY

		SIGN/HASH IMAGE 

	3. CREATE A 'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'

		SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR
		EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES

```

DISASTER RECOVERY

```
FAULT TOLERANCE = RECOVERY FROM FAULT

	EG RAID 5  :   DRIVE FAILS ==> STILL SURVIVE
	   CLUSTER :   SERVER FAILS ==> GO TO SERVERB

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE = ONE THING WHICH, IF IT BREAKS, 
		MAKES YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM FAIL (EG YOUR BRAIN!)

	ROUTER : GATEWAY : TO INTERNET
	SWITCH : CENTRAL POINT OF NETWORK

BCP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN : WRITTEN PLAN FOR ACTIVITY
		IN CERTAIN EVENTS EG WEBSITE GETS HACKED.

BIA BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS : WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THREAT
		X MATERIALIZES (IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS)

MTD MAX TOLERABLE DOWNTIME

	EG IF SERVER GOES DOWN, IT MUST BE UP WITHIN 2 DAYS	

RPO : RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

	HOW FREQUENT ARE YOUR BACKUPS???
	IF DISASTER, HOW MUCH DATA ARE YOUR PREPARED TO LOSE?
	EG EVERY 4 HOURS YOU BACKUP, THEN POTENTIALLY
	ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE 4 HOURS WORTH OF DATA?

RTO RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE : PLANNED TIME BY WHICH WE 
	HAVE FIXED AN ITEM AND GET EVERYTHING WORKING

```

HOT/WARM/COLD SITE

```
HOT SITE : 100% READY TO GO - COMPUTERS, NETWORK

		*** TOO COSTLY ! ***

WARM SITE : PCS THERE, SHUT DOWN.  1-2 DAYS TO GET SET 
	UP, RESTORE BACKUPS, BEGIN WORK.

		*** HIGH BUT REASONABLE COST **

COLD SITE : JUST BARE SHELL OF BUILDING WITH WATER AND
		ELECTRICITY AND LITTLE ELSE

	1-2 WEEKS TO SET UP

```

MTTF MEAN TIME TO FAIL = AVERAGE TIME BEFORE EG HARD DRIVE FAIL (3 YEARS)

```
==> MTBF MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES

```

MTTR MEAN TIME TO REPAIR : AVERAGE TIME TO FIX EG SERVER
