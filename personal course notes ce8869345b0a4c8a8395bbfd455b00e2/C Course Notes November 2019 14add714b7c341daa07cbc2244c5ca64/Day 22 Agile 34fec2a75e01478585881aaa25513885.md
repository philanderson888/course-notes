# Day 22 - Agile

# Agile

## Review of current knowledge

Epic - overall project 'container'

Backlog = list of tasks ('requirements')

User Stories - each task is written out in a form which a non-tech person can understand

Sprints - select certain items from Backlog and set a goal to complete those few items in a period of time 1-4 weeks

Scrum : way of building software

Manifest file is like a configuration file with instructions / metadata about a project

Scrum Master : helps flow of work (admin overview of work)

Kanban - environment where work never stops - flow of work rather than discrete sprints

## Agile Introduction

### Waterfall

First projects were built using a straight-forward method called Waterfall

SDLC Software Development Life Cycle

Feasibility Study - initial analysis to see if project is a good idea

```
ROI Return On Investment

	Money Spent : Money Returned

	How much money will this cost?   Expected income back

	Investor invest £100 - if he can get £110 back at end of year ROI is 10%
```

Analysis

```
Requirements Gathering 

		Talk to customer and find out what is their NEED FOR THIS PROJECT?

				Face to face, phone, surveys etc

		Requirements Engineering

			==> LIST OF REQUIREMENTS (this is the project!)

			BACKLOG = LIST OF REQUIREMENTS
```

Architecture = High Level Design

```
Project planning 

	TIMESCALE
	BUDGET   A) OVERALL B) IMMEDIATE CASH FLOW
	MANPOWER
	RESOURCES EG BUILDINGS ETC

Technical
	OS : Windows or MAC or Linux : Android/IOS Mobile
	Programming Language : Web/OOP C#, Java, Python, Go
	Legacy environment
		Greenfield project - startup with NO LEGACY TO WORRY ABOUT 
		Brownfield - tie in to legacy

Constraints : restrictions
	Legal
	Industry code of conduct 
	Timescale
```

Low level design

```
'Specification'  ie detail of projects ** instructions for coders **

	UI User interface : visual element, what user SEES
	UX User experience : flow of screens together, how the app responds and feels
			- is the flow natural, is the app easy to use 'intuitive'
```

Build

Testing

```
Note

	TDD Test Driven Development means WRITE TESTS FIRST!
		RED           Code fails tests initially 
		GREEN         Code written and passes tests
		REFACTOR      More efficient
	BDD Tests in human-friendly language (think USER STORIES)
		Behaviour Driven Development (Selenium, Cucumber, Gherkin syntax)
```

### Agile : Summary so far

SDLC stages
Feasibility Study : is project feasible
Analysis : Customer Requirements (BACKLOG - LIST OF REQUIREMENTS)
Architecture : High Level Design
Design : Low Level (detailed 'spec')
UI
UX
Technical
Build
Test

```
Release to production

	CI/CD Pipeline

	CI Continuous Integration (GitHub code)
	CD Continuous Deployment (Deploying small commits very often)

	Pipeline : Code => Tests => Send to Production all in one automatic flow

Ongoing Maintenance

	Help Desk
		Issues
		1) Bug Fix
		2) New Feature Request

Documentation
	1) User
	2) Technical
```

Waterfall Model

```
Fixed model
	Analysis=> Design=> Build => Test => Release in ONE FLOW

		Maintenance next

Advantages
	Good for smaller, repeating projects
		Car factory => software between models won't change much
	Good for projects where safety and stability are priority
		Bridge / Dam ==> software to be robust
		Military / Mission Critical

			V-model is WATERFALL PLUS EXTRA TESTING

				User List Of Requirements 							UAT User
					(Backlog) 									  	Acceptance Testing
					               									(user confirms that
					               									you have built the
					               									software correctly)

					Working System 								System Testing

						Join Modules                       Integration Testing

							Code Modules (Unit)       Unit Testing 

Disadvantages Of Waterfall

	Often whole process from start to finish can take several months.
	Requirements can CHANGE!!!  MESS UP WHOLE PROJECT!!!
	Waterfall : INFLEXIBLE
```

Agile

```
Agile Manifesto

	Embrace certain values

		WORKING SOFTWARE OVER DOCUMENTATION (value brought is only measured in actual
												working code)

		FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION is ALWAYS BEST  (DAILY STANDUP)
		
		COLLABORATION OVER NEGOTIATION (IE CUSTOMER IS SOMEONE WE WORK WITH)

		EMBRACE CHANGE OVER FOLLOWING A PLAN (TO A POINT OF REASON OF COURSE)

			BUSINESS CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE AT SHORT NOTICE
```

Scrum

```
Scrum is the PRACTICAL OUTWORKING OF AGILE

	Over the years we've had different names

		XP Extreme Programming (Pair programming)
		Lean (build minimum)

Today scrum is accepted as 'norm' for programmers working together scrum.org

3 Roles

	Scrum Master 		Not in charge  !   Servant-enabler to whole team, 
						Remove 'blockers' (hindrances) to team
						Organise meetings, book rooms, admin around team

	Product Owner 		Go-between between DEV TEAM AND CUSTOMER

						DEV TEAM ------ PRODUCT OWNER -----------CUSTOMER
						                   BACKLOG
						               LIST OF REQUIREMENTS

	Dev Team			Self-organising
						Jointly responsible for commitments made
							(Under-promise and Over-deliver)	
						3-9 people multi-skilled
```

Summary so far : Agile

```
Manifesto : thinking behind it 

Roles		Scrum master (enabler)
			Product owner 			Client go-between & owns BACKLOG LIST
			Dev Team 				3-9 people, self organising, multi-skilled
```

Agile In Practice

```
BACKLOG => LIST OF REQUIREMENTS IE build this!

	USER STORIES => HUMAN SIDE OF BACKLOG REQUIREMENTS

		WEIGHT (PRIORITY)
		COST   (DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY)

SPRINT 0 - FIRST SPRINT 

	GOAL : PRODUCE 'MVP' MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT IE FIRST WORKING VERSION, AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE

	EACH SPRINT : 4 MEETINGS

		SPRINT PLAN    Select 'for development' one or two features from MAIN BACKLOG.
						Create 'SPRINT BACKLOG' 
						Plan timescale eg 2 weeks
						Define 'DONE' eg Passing x TESTS

		DAILY STANDUP   DID YESTERDAY , DOING TODAY, BLOCKERS (PROBLEMS)

		SPRINT REVIEW   Invite customer to view our FINISHED PRODUCT (ITERATION / VERSION)
							((Working software is measure of success))

		SPRINT RETRO    Retrospective - internal review privately of what went good/bad/
										could be improved

SPRINT 1,2,3,4 ETC UNTIL FINAL PRODUCT IS BUILT

	IDEA IS THAT GOALS (BACKLOG) CAN CHANGE.  SPRINTS SMALL HELPS US TO BE 'AGILE' AND
	TO BE SENSITIVE TO CLIENT IF THEY NEED CHANGE.

	BUT!!!

		Use our PROFESSIONAL SKILLS TO GUIDE CUSTOMER IN ANY DECISIONS / THOUGHT PROCESSES
		WHICH THEY WANT TO CHANGE IE SPEC.  Don't let them just be unprofessional in the
		way they change the spec.

	Sprints help because they provide CLEAR, PRECISE PERIODS OF WORK WITH A CLEAR GOAL
```

Other types of Agile

```
Kanban

	JIT Just In Time : lean process for delivery at right time to minimise high stock levels

	Kanban is a development METHODOLOGY ((WAY OF DOING WORK)) such that the work never
		stops but is going 24/7 and useful for eg manufacturing plants

		BACKLOG    SELECTED FOR DEV    IN PROGRESS      FOR REVIEW          COMPLETE

		                                  LIMIT
		                                  AMOUNT
		                                  HERE
