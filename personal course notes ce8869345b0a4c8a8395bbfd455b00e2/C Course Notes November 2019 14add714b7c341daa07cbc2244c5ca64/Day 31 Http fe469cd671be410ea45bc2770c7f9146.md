# Day 31 - Http

# Http

Using .NET we can read and write to the web.

`WebClient` can be used to trivially download data

Let's begin by just downloading some complete files then we can move onto streaming

We can do this via SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS methods

SYNCHRONOUS : WAIT
ASYNCH : DON'T WAIT BUT JUST LET DATA ARRIVE BUT IT DOES NOT 'HANG' OUR CODE
