## Intro

Backwards compatible

Roku

Compiles into bytecode which is run by an interpreter.  This compilation step happens every time a script is loaded and run.  There is no saved, compiled, stored binary file to deal with.  So this is similar to Javascript.

Brightscript statement syntax similar to Python, Basic, Ruby, Lua

Objects are associative arrays which have key/value pairs

Uses Interfaces

Uses Integers by default, floats are not default

Dynamic and Static types OK

Written in C!!!
