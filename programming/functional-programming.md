What is functional programming? 

Allows you to write     
    Compressed code 
    Predictable code 
    Easier to test 
    
It
    Combines Pure Functions   
    Uses a declarative approach rather than an imperative approach 
    Declarative 
    Imperative 
    
It Avoids 
    Shared state 
    Mutable (changeable) data 
       
Functional programming key terms 
        
    Pure functions
    
        are Deterministic (output is predictable given the same input) 
    
        Have no side effects 
    
    Function composition 
    
        combine two functions 
    
        Avoid shared state 
    
        shared state force knowing the full history of a variable 
    
    Immutability 
    
        Cannot change the object to which you are bound 
    
        But can still change the properties of the object 
    
        Side effects are interactions which affect other areas and do not just stay within the confines of the function 
    
    Imperative

        Disadvantage of functional programming 
    
        No purely functional 'weak hash map'
