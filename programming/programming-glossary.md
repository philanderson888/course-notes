Imperative programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python â€¦)

### Mixin

mixins allow code to be `injected`

see 

```java
class MixinParent {
  parentBehaviour() {
    print('parent is doing this');
  }
}

class MixinChild01 extends MixinParent {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild01 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

class MixinChild02 extends MixinParent {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild02 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

class MixinChild03 extends MixinParent with InjectCode01, InjectCode02 {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild03 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

mixin InjectCode01 {
  uniqueBehaviour01() {
    print('doing some pretty unique stuff');
  }
}

mixin InjectCode02 {
  uniqueBehaviour02() {
    print('doing some more pretty unique stuff');
  }
}
```

```java
print('mixin demo');
print(' ');
var mixinParent = MixinParent();
var mixinChild01 = MixinChild01();
var mixinChild02 = MixinChild02();
var mixinChild03 = MixinChild03();
mixinParent.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild01.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild02.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild03.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild03.uniqueBehaviour01();
mixinChild03.uniqueBehaviour02();
