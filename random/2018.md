Network models

```
Domain

    Central Server “DOMAIN CONTROLLER” (DC)

        Windows ==> Active Directory creates domain

    Multimaster model : each DC has full rights to update
            domain database e.g. new user, group etc

    PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP

Client/Server

        Temporary e.g. online banking

Workgroup

        DEFAULT ==> no server at all, just clients on network

Peer-to-peer

    COMMON TO SHARE WORKLOAD

        e.g.  WINDOWS UPDATES ==> DOWNLOADED TO WIN10 
        BUT SHARED WITH PEOPLE A) LAN B) INTERNET	
        ((Old days ==> ONE CENTRAL SERVER, GET FILES FROM
                    SERVER EG WITH FTP (FILE TRANSFER 											PROTOCOL)
        Peer-to-peer : CHOP FILE INTO SEEDS.  DOWNLOAD
                SEEDS.   CAN SHARE SEEDS WITH OTHERS.

```

LAN
Client ==> Switch ==> Router ==> ((Modem))

WAN

```
Client => Switch => Router => Modem —————dial up———

                ISP Router ———> INTERNET

```

WAN with VPN

```
                            encrypted tunnel
LAN1==> Router1==================Router2 => LAN2

        All machines on LAN1 share same GATEWAY which
            is Router1.   They connect through this to LAN2

```

PAN
Personal Area Network

```
    BLUETOOTH : DIRECT CONNECTION

            EG PRINT TO PRINTER OVER BLUETOOTH

            ((TODAY WIFI DIRECT ALSO DOES THIS))

```

MAN
Metropolitan : city-wide e.g. Hospital/Bank/University

```
            ((usually. FIBER OPTIC))

```

LAN COMPONENTS

```
Hub

    FIRST EVER LAN DEVICE

        Good

        Bad
            BROADCASTS ALL DATA ON EVERY PORT

        Speed 10Mbps max, 

                1/n. For every device.   1/5 for 5 Devices

```

Bridge

```
Used to connect 2 NETWORKS OF DIFFERENT TYPES

        Ethernet == BRIDGE == Token Ring

```

Repeater

```
Ethernet 100m MAX

                 100m                          repeater          100m
    |<—————————————>|<——————————->

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10Mbps. :  MADE THICK COAX CALLED “ THICKNET  ”

this changed to 

 10Mbps. THINNET (common TV cable of today)

```

7 Layer Model Of Networking

```
Used 1) Theory 2) Real world

1. 	Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Layer 1 : Physical
    
        ANYTHING YOU CAN TOUCH

        CABLING
                        COPPER
                                    COAX
                                    ETHERNET
                        FIBER
        PORTS
        

Layer 2 : Data Link

        DEALS WITH GETTING DATA ROUND OUR LAN

            USE UNIQUE ETHERNET ADDRESS
                                  (MAC address)
                                (Physical address)

                                IPCONFIG ==> SHOW IP address
                                IPCONFIG /ALL.  ==> SHOW MAC address

        MAC address IS UNIQUE ON LAN

                TWO PARTS

                1ST HALF : OUI : NAME OF COMPANY WHICH BUILT 
                                                             CARD
                                ((OUI  organisationally unique id))

                2nd HALF : UNIQUE ID SO FULL MAC address IS
                                    UNIQUE

        SWITCH

                Inspect ‘to’ address of ETHERNET ‘FRAME’

        ETHERNET FRAME

                Preamble : notification that data is following
                To : 
                From:
                Data :   1500 bytes max
                CRC. : 	Error check (( check data not lost in transit)

        SWITCH : INSPECT ‘TO’ ADDRESS

                create SWITCHING TABLE

                PHYSICAL			MAC 
                PORT

                1							AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF
                2							….

            Data arrives : check ‘to’ address and see if there is a match
                    in switching table

                    IF MATCH : SEND OUT ON THAT PORT
                    IF NO MATCH : BROADCAST ON ALL PORTS

                                        ((ETHERNET : FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
                                             All one’s broadcast address))

Layer 3 : Network Layer

        Layer 1 ; cabling etc
        Layer 2 : LOCAL LAN ONLY
        Layer 3 : IP CAN TALK TO GLOBAL INTERNET

                Public 
                            VALID ANYWHERE ON INTERNET
                            (( our address ==> WHATISMYIP ))
                                ((THIS IS OUR LAN ROUTER == GATEWAY ))
                Private
                        4 ranges
                            1)	10.X.Y.Z

Layer 3 : ROUTING

        ROUTING DOES TWO THINGS
    
            1) CREATE FAST ROUTES (CHANNELS) FOR DATA TO 
                                                               FLOW
                        ((Think : build road infrastructure in a country))	

            2) SEND DATA

        ROUTING PROTOCOL

                SOFTWARE WORKING ON ROUTERS

                ENABLE ONE ROUTER TO TALK WITH ANOTHER
                        ROUTER AND SHARE ‘BEST ROUTES’

                EG 
                    RIP
                    EIGRP
                    OSPF
                    BGP

                A) RIP : Routing Internet Protocol

                        RIPV2. Is in use now
                        Uses ‘HOPS’ to measure distance

                                ((Look at.  PING/ PATHPING / TRACERT))

                                                                  ((TRACEROUTE LINUX))
                
                            HOP COUNT == ‘METRIC’.  (MEASUREMENT 
                                            OF DISTANCE ACROSS INTERNET)

                    RIP : BAD POINTS : EVERY 30 SECONDS IT WILL
                            BROADCAST TO ALL ROUTERS ITS FULL
                            ROUTING TABLE!!!!    Creating NOISE!!!

                2). EIGRP.    ((Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing 
                                            Protocol))		
                            CISCO
                                        HOPS FOR DISTANCE											DATA SENT 1-1 UNICAST
                                        ONLY CHANGES SENT
                

                3) OSPF. Open Shortest Path First

                        SPLIT WORLD INTO ‘AREAS’
        
                            ((think paper letter : to S.America=> Brazil => 
                                        Sao Paulo => District => Street => 5))

                    EVERY COMPANY GETS GLOBAL ID : SEND DATA TO 
                    THIS ID AND INTERNALLY COMPANY CREATE 
                    AREAS TO GET DATA TO FINAL DESTINATION

            4)   BGP BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL : BACKBONE (
                        Fast Internet )

    Layer 4 : Transport Layer

            Layer 1 : Cabling
            Layer 2 : Local Network
            Layer 3 : Global IP

            Layer 3 lacks CHECKING THAT DATA HAS ARRIVED

            Layer 4 provides two fields 

                1) SEQUENCE NUMBER : 1,2,3,4,5,… COUNT PACKETS
                                                                                OUT
                2) ACK (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) 1,2,3,4,5.  RECEIVER 
                                CAN LET SENDER KNOW DATA ARRIVED

                SEND 5 PACKETS : SEQ 1,2,3,4,5 
                RECEIVER : ACK 1,2,4,5
                SENDER : PACKET 3 MISSING : RESEND 3
                RECEIVER : ACK 3

        TCP : 3-WAY HANDSHAKE TO BEGIN
                1) Sender : are you ready?  2) Receiver : yes 3) Sender : 
                                                          Let’s begin

                TCP : SLOW!!!

        UDP : CAN BE USED IF NO CHECKING NEEDED

                User Datagram Protocol

                FAST BUT NO CHECKING : USEFUL EG 
                                        YOUTUBE/STREAMING

        TCP : CHECK (SLOW)
        UDP : FAST BUT NO CHECK

    Layer 5 : Session

        CREATES ‘FLOW/STREAM OF DATA TO/FROM COMPUTER’

        EG. 5 tabs in browser: each playing same Youtube video

                ==> SESSION LAYER SORT STREAMS

     Layer 6 : Presentation

            1) ENCRYPTION

            2) COMPRESSION

                    e.g. WAV audio => compress to MP3
                           RAW/BMP image ==> compress to JPG
                            WMV         ==> MP4

Packet Switch vs Circuit Switch

    Circuit switch

        one wire ==> all electricity can only go down one wire
                (phone line)

            no choice!!!

        Circuit switched path ==> fixed path, signal has no choice				
        Virtual circuit eg during phone call : create it but then
            fix it for that call.  

            PVC permanent
            SCV switched temporary  (inside switch)

    Packet switch

        Each router is INDEPENDENT

            Each IP packet makes OWN WAY TO DESTINATION

        No fixed route!!!

    
Carrying data quickly inside eg BT

    Old	
        1) X25		BAD ANSWER LIKE HUB/WEP

        2) Frame Relay	

                UniqueID for routes   DLCI Data Link Connection
                                ID

        3) MPLS  currently  Multi Protocol Layer Switch

        ===> THESE GIVE CIR Commited Info Rate ie guaranteed speed

NETWORK COMPONENTS

HUB

```
FIRST EVER NETWORKS CREATED USED HUBS

PURELY FORWARD ELECTICITY ARRIVING AT ONE PORT, 
SEND OUT SAME PULSES ON ALL OTHER PORTS

---->IN---HUB===> OUT (SAME SIGNAL)

THIS WAS GOOD FOR SMALL NETWORKS.

TODAY HUBS ARE TERRIBLE.

    BECAUSE ==> BROADCAST TRAFFIC TO ALL DEVICES ALWAYS

        CREATE 'NOISE' ON NETWORK

    ((UNICAST = 1-1))
    ((BROADCAST = 1 TO MANY))		

SPEED OF HUB = 10Mbps

BUT DECREASES WITH N DEVICES TO 1/N SPEED

10 DEVICES ==> 1/10 SPEED (AT BEST)

```

BRIDGE

```
OLD, WAS USED TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORKS

    EG TOKEN RING FROM IBM TO ETHERNET

    (WORKS AT LAYER 2)

```

REPEATER

```
LIKE HUB 

ONLY GOT 2 PORTS 

JUST USED TO EXTEND LENGTH OF A NETWORK

EG

ETHERNET 100M MAX LENGTH

    100M : REPEATER : 100M 

    -----200m total-------

    
5-4-3 rule : 5 NETWORKS WITH 4 REPEATERS BUT ONLY 3 CAN 
        HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEM!

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10 MBPS  : USED THICK COAX CABLE CALLED 'THICKNET'  

THEN

10 MBPS  : THINNET (STILL COAX) - LIKE TV CABLE TODAY

THEN

ETHERNET : 10/100/1000/10000 MBPS TODAY!!!

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
USED BY STUDENTS AND REAL-WORLD ENGINEERS!

LAYER 1 PHYSICAL

    SENDING OUT ELECTICAL PULSES

    WIRE : COPPER OR FIBER

    WIFI : WIFI SIGNAL

    ENCODE : SEND DATA OUT IN FORMAT SO IT CAN 
        GET FROM A TO B WITHOUT LOSING 
        DEFINITION OF SIGNAL

    PHYSICAL NETWORK PORT

LAYER 2 DATA LINK

    LOCAL LAN TRAFFIC

    EACH DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE ADDRESS CALLED A 'MAC
    ADDRESS'

        MAC = MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

    EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE

        2 PARTS : COMPANY ID + UNIQUE PART

              (( OUI ))

    VIEW MAC ADDRESS ==> IPCONFIG /ALL

LAYER 3 NETWORK

    LAYER 1  : PHYSICAL
    LAYER 2  : LOCAL ADDRESSES (LAN ONLY)

    LAYER 3  : GLOBAL ADDRESSING SCHEME VALID ACROSS
           ENTIRE WORLD : UNIQUE ADDRESSES IDENTIFY
           COMPUTERS

           EG GOOGLE SERVER AT 173.194.116.193

```

LAYER 2 : LAN ADDRESS : MAC ADDRESS : PHYSICAL ADDRESS : ETHERNET PROTOCOL

LAYER 3 : GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

```
MAC ADDRESS : VALID ON LAN ONLY

IP ADDRESS : VALID GLOBALLY (IF YOU PAY FOR ONE!) 

    PRIVATE IP : FREE, INTERNAL USE

        10.X.Y.Z, 172.16-172.31.Y.Z , 192.168.X.Y

        (( APIPA   169.254.X.Y  ==> DHCP NOT WORKING))

    ROUTERS ALSO WORK HERE

        TALK TO OTHER ROUTERS : CREATE PATHS
        ACROSS THE WORLD FOR FASTEST WAY TO GET
        DATA FROM A TO B

        CREATE 'ROUTING TABLE' OF BEST ROUTES

        DATA COMES IN ==> DATA SENT DOWN BEST ROUTE

```

ROUTING PROTOCOLS

```
ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER.  THEY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
    ROUTES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT.  THEY USE THIS TO 
    BUILD 'BEST ROUTES' ROUND THE INTERNET

ROUTING PROTOCOL IS A LANGUAGE THAT ROUTERS USE TO TALK 
    TO EACH OTHER

RIP   ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL

    OLDEST PROTOCOL

    'BROADCAST' BASED ==> WHOLE ROUTING TABLE GETS
    SENT OUT TO ALL ROUTERS EVERY 30 SECONDS	

    (EVEN IF NO CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE)

METRIC = WAY TO MEASURE STUFF

    MEASURES DISTANCE IN 'HOPS'

    ONE HOP = ONE ROUTER 'BOUNCE' ALONG THE WAY

    BEST ROUTES CHOSEN WITH LOWEST 'HOP' COUNT

EIGRP

    CISCO : SIMILAR BUT FASTER AND ONLY SEND OUT DATA
    IF CHANGES ARE PRESENT

OSPF

    DIVIDES THE WORLD INTO 'AREAS' LIKE CONTINENTS AND
    COUNTRIES.  SEND DATA TO AN AREA, THEN SUB-AREA ETC

    AUSTRALASIA => AUSTRALIA => WEST => MELBOURNE 
        ==> STREET => HOUSE NUMBER

BGP
    BACKBONE OF INTERNET (FAST)
    
    
    
    
    
    
LAYER 4 TRANSPORT

    LAYER 3 : IP PACKETS  BUT PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT

        - LIKE A REGULAR POSTMAN - THERE IS NO 
            RECORD OF DELIVERY 

        "CONNECTIONLESS" 

    LAYER 4 : TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

        - COUNT AND CHECK ALL PACKETS IN AND OUT

        ==> SENDING : OUT : USE A 'SEQ' SEQUENCE NUMBER

        ==> CONFIRMING RECEIPT : USE AN 'ACK'
                ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER

            SEND : SEQ : 3,4,5,6,7
                   ACK : 3,4,6, 7

            ACK PACKETS SENT BACK TO ORIGINAL 
            SENDER.  SENDER FLAGGED THAT PACKET
            5 HAS GONE MISSING

            PACKET 5 RESENT!!!

        " BETTER SLOW DATA THAN NO DATA "

            TCP IS SLOWER BUT PEACE OF MIND
            DATA IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING

        TCP : CHECKS

        UDP : USED WHERE NO CHECKING REQUIRED

            (BLANK, DUMMY PROTOCOL)

            UDP ==> VERY FAST!!
        
            EG STREAMING RADIO STATION

LAYER 5 SESSION

    CREATES AND MANAGES 'SESSIONS' OR 'STREAMS OF TRAFFIC'

    EG SKYPE + EMAIL + TEXT CHAT + BROWSE INTERNET : ALL
        TRAFFIC GETS PUT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION

    EG MULTIPLE TABS ON A BROWSER

LAYER 6 PRESENTATION

    COMPRESS DATA

        EG WAV (UNCOMPRESSED) ==> MP3/WEBM
    
    ENCRYPT DATA

LAYER 7 APPLICATION

    PROGRAM WHICH IS REQUESTING ACCESS TO NETWORK
    EG OUTLOOK OR SKYPE ETC

```

SWITCHES

```
LAYER 2 DEVICE

FILTER ALL TRAFFIC USING 'MAC ADDRESS' OF EVERY DEVICE
    ATTACHED

BUILD UP A 'SWITCHING TABLE' OF ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

PORT		MAC ADDRESS

1		30-85-A9-9A-6B-B5
2		00-50-56-C0-00-01
3		00-50-56-C0-00-08

ETHERNET PACKET GETS SENT FROM A DEVICE TO SWITCH

|-----data--------------|SOURCE MAC |  DESTINATION MAC |
                       00-50-56-C0-00-08

            |---------header---------------|

    ==> SWITCH CHECKS TABLE AND IN THIS INSTANCE
        FINDS A MATCH ON PORT 3 SO WILL FORWARD
        ETHERNET PACKET TO DEVICE ON PORT 3

EACH IP ADDRESS IS LIKE A SECURE CASTLE WITH 65536 SECURE
    ENTRY POINTS

    YOU CAN'T SEND DATA INTO THIS DEVICE WITHOUT 		
    USING ONE OF THESE CHANNELS

    EG WEB TRAFFIC : HTTP : USES PORT 80 (EVEN IF NOT 
                    STATED)		

             HTTPS : USES PORT 443

    SEND EMAIL : USE SMTP PROTOCOL : USES PORT 25

    FTP DOWNLOAD : USES PORT 20/21

    REMOTE DESKTOP : 3389

NETWORKING : TCP/IP

```
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TCP/IP???

    COLD WAR : RUSSIA VS US

    GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK WITH FOLLOWING
        CHARACTERISTICS

    1) NODES WERE INDEPENDENT AND NOT CENTRALLY MANAGED

    2) TRAFFIC GETS FROM A TO B WITH ROUTING AGAIN 
        NOT DICTACTED CENTRALLY BUT LOCAL 
        ROUTING DECISIONS TAKEN 'AUTONOMOUSLY'

    GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT COULD
    AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE A NUCLEAR WAR WITH WHOLE 
    CITIES GOING OUT.  NETWORK WOULD SURVIVE AND RE-ROUTE
    ON SURVIVING NODES

ROUTABLE PROTOCOL : CAN SEND DATA ROUND WORLD

    NON-ROUTABLE PROTOCOLS ARE LOCAL LAN ONLY

        EG 

            ETHERNET
            NETBIOS   (USES HOST NAME ONLY)
            APPLETALK

BINARY NUMBERING

SUBNET MASK

    SPLIT IP ADDRESS INTO 2 PARTS

    LEFT : NETWORK ID  (SAME FOR ALL COMPUTERS)

    RIGHT : HOST (UNIQUE PC ID)

    EXAMPLE : MOST COMMON MASK = 'CLASS C'

SPLIT POINT CREATES 

    LEFT : NETWORK ID IS NOW 192.168.1

    RIGHT : HOST PC ID IS NOW  22

GATEWAY IS ROUTER TO INTERNET : ALL TRAFFIC THROUGH THIS

DHCP PROCESS

    COMPUTER BOOTS (NEVER HAD IP)

    BROADCAST DHCPREQUEST 'I NEED IP'
    
    SERVER : DHCP OFFER IP

BOOTP WAS PRIMITIVE FORERUNNER TO DHCP 

    BOOTP = DHCP

DHCP RELAY AGENT : DHCP SERVER : TO AVOID PUTTING ONE SERVER
    FOR EVERY SWITCH, YOU CAN SET YOUR ROUTERS TO FORWARD

# MTA Security

MTA 98-367 Security

Encryption

```
3 types of encryption

1) Symmetric 
	Session Encryption (eg Shopping 'session')
2) Asymmetric
3) Hashing
	
Also 2) and 3) combined ==> Digital Signatures and Certificates
		
	==> foundation for all INTERNET SECURITY

```

Symmetric Encryption = Shared Key

```
WIFI

Plain text	ALGORITHM	KEY		Encrypted text
				(WIFI key)

		SAME		unique

		WEP
		WPA 
		WPA2

WIFI is relatively INSECURE because ONE KEY is both
	doing ENCRYPTION and DECRYPTION

	One key is doing so much work ==> vulnerability

Passwords tend to be quite weak also so we can do two things
	1) SALT
	2) KEY STRETCHING

SALT : BCrypt is a tradename for this technology

Plain text + WPA2 + WIFI Key + SALT (extra password) ==> Final
							 encrypted
							 text

	regular password + salt ==> extended password

	If hacker did ever work out the (stored) extended password
		then they still can't hack your account until
		they next get the salt.

Exam
	WEP 	hacked
	WPA	over	TKIP	
	WPA2 	over	AES

Older protocols

	DES
	3DES	which is data run through DES three times
	Bluefish
	Twofish
	RC2  /   RC4

```

Asymmetric Encryption

```
Two keys : Public key & Private key

Public key : anyone can have
Private key : must be kept secure eg private ATM debit card in
			wallet.

Encrypt data ==> use either key!!!

	Decrypt data ==> must use OTHER KEY 

Examples

	Jill send Bob some encrypted data that ONLY BOB CAN OPEN

	Bob send Jill his PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE
	Jill can import this and install it on her computer

		Double click on certificate ==> runs 'import 
		certificate' wizard

	Select her file and encrypt with BOB'S PUBLIC KEY
	
	Send encrypted file to Bob

	Bob ==> use his own PRIVATE KEY to DECRYPT FILE AND READ IT

		((Bob is only person in world with this private key))

Second example

	A military commander wants to send a message to the troops

	Commander : encrypt message with PRIVATE KEY
	Send to troops.
	They can use COMMANDER'S PUBLIC KEY TO DECRYPT ==> can
		now be sure message came from commander and 
		can be trusted.

Exam
	RSA most common protocol  ((Remember : Republic of South
						Africa!!!!))

```

Hashing

```
Hashing is also called 'one way encryption' because there is no way
	to reverse engineer your hash

input file/text		MD5	===> produce hash
			SHA1

MD5 weak
SHA1 stronger

today

SHA256
SHA512 in real life

Examples sha1-online.com

		MD5
phil		d14ffd41334ec4b4b3f2c0d55c38be6f
phil <space>	fdcffb2dda54dff940c0a541f1cee85c	
phil.		dcd4936713c27cae72c65e90c1e60a66	

Compare with 

SHA1		e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

SHA256					4b25923a4f31b83195ceb0d160e0a1a6d1
		556b5a2cd4c582ff40aa0498ae1578

SHA512					055244bd6fc27c55e1ee33f71a0fd87e32bd
		9b1d19bd7ed636a6588b375a1e966a45c3e1
		4707d4ea45ed35a13cd95fa7df420fa52cfb
		b190ee0497c9dbcc33fb

Warning!!!

	Attackers cannot REVERSE ENGINEER then they do the 
		next best thing

	They collect HASHES in large files called RAINBOW TABLES

```

Session Key Encryption

```
Online shopping needs to be FAST!!!

HTTPS uses the following technology

1) Use ASYMMETRIC KEYS (slow) to GENERATE SYMMETRIC KEYS (fast)

2) Use, for our website browsing, these SYMMETRIC KEYS (fast)

	BUT!!  symmetric keys are ALSO WEAK!!! EASILY HACKED!!!

3) Every 10 minutes, just create new SYMMETRIC KEYS!!!

This gives us

	FAST BROWSING (symmetric key)

	SECURE BROWSING (sessions only last 10 minutes)

```

Certificates and Digital Signing

```
We can create CERTIFICATES and use DIGITAL SIGNING to create
a secure environment for business around the world

1. Take our files which we want to 'sign'

2. Hash these files           files  +   hash

3. Private key : encrypt the hash

			      files   +   hash    + encryped hash

4. Call the 'encrypted hash' the SIGNATURE of the file

	It represents the file uniquely

	file ===>   encrypted hash (signature of file)

Now we may want to validate this file and the signature

	eg COURT OF LAW
	eg DRIVER SIGNATURE BEFORE INSTALL (ALL DRIVERS ARE SIGNED)
			

Validation process

	1. Take our FILE and the SIGNATURE (encrypted hash)

	2. To validate we also now need the PUBLIC KEY OF
		THE PERSON WHO SIGNED THE FILE

		((think driver : get Microsoft's public key))
			((stored in CERTIFICATE ROOT STORE))
	
	3. Take PUBLIC KEY and use it to DECRYPT THE HASH!!!

		file  +  hash 

	4. Revalidate the hash is good.

		file ==> afresh, run it through hashing algorithm
			and get another fresh hash

		file  + hash   +   fresh hash

	5.  if two hashes (old and new) match then DRIVER IS 
		VALID AND GOOD TO INSTALL

```

```
NAC Network Access Control

With many employees working from home and dialing in using VPN
	we have potentially an issue with viruses spreading
	from home into the workplace.  Also laptops used outside
	the LAN can infect the workplace when plugged in.

Solution

	NAP

		When a machine connects to corporate network 
		we check :

		1) 	Windows Updates : up to date

		2)	AntiVirus : on and up to date

		3)	Antivirus scan : no viruses

		Do a 'health check' on machine

		If Fail ==> use DHCP to put machine into
			quarantine to 'force' machine to become
			compliant

		==> Pass ==> Certificate of health 

			==> allowed onto network

Routing

	Distance Vector

		RIP : old  (30 seconds : all data broadcast)

		EIGRP : new			

		Distance : hops (31 max)

	Link State

		Split globe into 'areas'

		Every company gets unique ID
		Send data to company and internally route via
			smaller areas

		OSPF

		Bigger, complex, more expensive to run

DHCP 

	lease time : 8 days

	do nothing : renew at 1/2 time ie 4 days

Loops

	SWITCHES

		STP Spanning Tree Protocol : auto-stop loops

	ROUTERS

		Convergence : time to stabilise after a change
				takes place

		Split Horizon

			Don't advertise routes back to the 
			interface they came from 

		Poison Reverse

			Allocate high cost (hop count = 16) to
			any routes going back to original router

```

ADVANCED ATTACKS

```
Injection attacks

	SQL injection
	XML injection
	LDAP injection

	Fight against this by using INPUT VALIDATION

		Prevent odd characters from displaying etc

Man in the middle attack

	CLIENT------------BAD ROUTER-------------SERVER

		1) Eavesdropping : listen in to traffic								(should encrypt!)
		2) Alter data in some way 

Session hijack attack

	CLIENT-----------BAD ROUTER--------------SERVER

	CLIENT-----------BAD ROUTER              SERVER

	Client : thinks they are talking to server but no longer!!!

			Router has taken over full session

Replay attack

	BAD ROUTER will collect all the packets from a session.

		Later on, will fire packets back at, say the server.

			Server might think this is the client trying
			to connect again so begin communication.  
			Open door for bad router to infect server

	Guard against ==> TIMESTAMP ALL PACKETS

```

Encryption on VPN and LAN traffic

```
1) VPN across internet

	L2TP tunnel : encrypt data with IPSEC (strong)

	IKEV2 tunnel :                  IPSEC (strong)

	SSTP tunnel :                   SSL/TLS (strong)

2) Machine-to-machine ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LAN

	Put RAW IPSEC BY ITSELF as encryption mechanism 
		between 2 computers or group of computers

	!!! care !!!  lock down computers !!! 

	Set up IPSEC in 2 places
		1) firewall : advanced
		2) Group policy

	AH	Authentication header	- ID/login
	ESP	Encryption of data
	SA	Security Association is a live channel

	IPSEC types

		DOMAIN ISOLATION : all computers in domain 
					have IPSEC on

		TUNNEL MODE : to subnet (group of computers)

		POINT-TO-POINT (END-TO-END) TRANSPORT MODE

			between 2 individual computers

```

Virtual Smart Cards

```
Real smart card

	SERVER : HOLD PUBLIC CERTIFICATE

	USER : CARD : HOLD COPY PRIVATE KEY  (SECURE)

		Validate with your smart card : key pair activate
		to provide assurance it's you.

Virtual Smart Card

	Create a 'virtual' card which is not real but stored in
		the RAM of your computer

		==> use it to perform transactions instead of swiping
			a real smart card

```

Encrypting DNS

```
DNS by itself is PLAIN TEXT

Secure it 2 methods

	1) Put DNS inside Kerberos/Active Directory secure 
		encrypted data.   DNS fully hidden in same
		technology that protects Active Directory.

	2) DNS SEC  : add PKI certificates to DNS records to ensure
		they are 			
		1) from correct sender
		2) not corrupted in transit (hash integrity)

```

Advanced Network Attacks

```
XSS Cross Site Scriping

	Hacking into second website by gaining access to first
		website.

XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery

	If you are LOGGED IN ALREADY THEN COMPUTER GRANT YOU
	PERMISSION TO ACCESS FILES. MORE POWER TO HACK FROM
	ONE WEBSITE TO ANOTHER

Buffer Overflow

	Cache : temporary file store

	Buffer : use on NETWORK DEVICES as 'cushion' when sending
			data

		Buffer overflow attack : exceed approved memory	
		limits to perhaps hack in to other (restricted)
		areas of memory

DNS Poison
	
	Corrupt DNS records  (Pharming)

```

Protecting your WIFI

```
1) Turn off SSID broadcast : minor benefit.

2) MAC filtering : STRONG but LOTS OF WORK!!! 

3) 802.1x port security/blocking : certificates to validate
		devices : advanced but good

4) turn off unused ports

```

Email protection

```
PGP		encrypt email
S/MIME		encrypt email

SPF sender policy framework : ENSURE SENDER IS REAL SENDER

```

Internet Explorer

```
Zones
	Internet
	Intranet
	Blocked
	Allowed

Popups
	
SmartScreen filter  	list of banned websites

Inprivate browsing	Chrome Incognito 	NO HISTORY		

Inprivate filtering

	Block on COOKIES tracking your behaviour
	set limit eg 10 hits OK but any more than this : block	

```

Hardening your server

```
LOCK IT DOWN!!!!

a) Uninstall ROLES/APPS not needed
b) firewall ports
c) server GUI ==> remove GUI so only have SERVER CORE
d) check updates 
e) Analyse server for weaknesses

	MBSA Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser

		free download

7 Layer OSI Model

1. Physical

    Job of physical layer is to actually pulse out electricity
    from your machine onto the network

    Cabling
    Ethernet
    UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair
    STP Shielded Twisted Pair
    RJ45
    COAX

    ```
     	RG58  (TV cable today) (Thinnet)

     	RG8   (original COAX 'Thicknet')

     	Connector : BNC connector
     		    F-connector

     Fiber
     	MonoMode : Expensive Pure Laser (50km)
     	Multimode : Cheap LED light (2km)

     	Connector : MT-RJ, ST, SC

    ```

    WIFI
    Sending signals using EM (electromagnetic) radiation

    DEVICES AT LAYER 1

    ```
     CABLES
     
     HUB : Primitive device which has no knowledge of 			packets etc.  Just electricity in and electricity 
     out.  
     	BAD : BROADCASTS ON ALL PORTS, ALL TRAFFIC
     			RECEIVED
     REPEATER
     	Extend Ethernet max distance (100m) eg
     		to 200m or even more

     	 ((5-4-3 rule : max of 5 repeaters))

    ```

Layer 2 : Data Link Layer

```
Uses MAC Address to SEND SIGNALS LOCALLY ON LAN
MAC ADDRESS  :  PHYSICAL ADDRESS 

	IPCONFIG /ALL

		30-85-A9-9A-6D-0C

	VALID ON LAN ONLY

	ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA AROUND OUR
		LAN, USING MAC ADDRESS OF EACH COMPUTER
		AS UNIQUE ID

		NOTE : ETHERNET FRAME = UNIT OF DATA

DEVICE WORKING AT THIS LAYER	

SWITCH

	UNLIKE THE HUB, THE SWITCH IS SUPER EFFICIENT

	HUB SPEEDS : MAX 10MBPS AND 1/n IF n DEVICES 
				CONNECTED
		     20 DEVICES : ONLY GET 1/20 OF 10MPBS!!!			
	SWITCH SPEEDS : NEARLY ALL DEVICES GET FULL SPEED
			OF SWITCH EG 100MBPS OR 1000MBPS

		(MBPS = MEGA BITS PER SECOND)

		((Does this by creating a 'virtual circuit'
			in switch for each connection))

	((Stacking Switches : use UPLINK or TRUNKING port
				to connect!!!))

LAYER 2 SUMMARY 
	LAN ONLY!
	SWITCHES USE MAC ADDRESS TO GET DATA ROUND LAN
	ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA 'FRAMES'

```

Layer 3 : Network Layer
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN
Layer 3 : Global Internet = WAN

```
IP address

	Two types : private and public

	Private IP
		EG 
			192.168.x.y
			172.16.x.y-172.31.x.y
			10.x.y.z

		ALSO    169.254.X.Y  (APIPA ADDRESS IF
					DHCP FAILS)	

		ALSO 	127.0.0.1  LOOPBACK IP TEST ADDRESS
				   (IS IP WORKING ON MY PC)			
			PING 127.0.0.1
			PING LOCALHOST
			PING ::1

		Private IP Addresses are FREE  but NOT
		VALID FOR USE ON THE INTERNET

	Public IP

		Use 'whatismyip' to find out your PUBLIC IP!

		Public IP addresses cost money around $5 a 
			month

		So : only buy one and allocate to our
			'Default Gateway'

		VALID FOR USE ON GLOBAL INTERNET TO GET 
		TRAFFIC FROM A TO B

Routing

	Routing enables data to be sent around the world

	Routers : share info amongst each other on routes

		Data shared using 'Routing Protocol' like
		RIP or OSPF to share BEST ROUTES with
		NEIGHBOURING ROUTERS

	Distance can be measured in 'hops' (1 hop is 
		1 router to next)

		or GEOGRAPHIC 'AREAS' SIMILAR TO POSTAL
		SERVICE WITH CONTINENT/COUNTRY/REGION/CITY/
		STREET/HOUSE NUMBER

		(( PATHPING

		   TRACERT  ))

```

Layer 4 : Transport

```
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN Ethernet Addressing
Layer 3 : IP Global Addressing

	Problem with Layer 3 is that no tracking is provided

	Packets are sent 'connection-less' and we have 
		no idea if they arrived or not.

TCP

	Has two fields to check and count all packets
	out and received

	1) SEQUENCE NUMBER = PACKETS SENT 1,2,3,4,5

	2) ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER = RECEIVER WILL SEND
		BACK A NOTE OF THE PACKETS WHICH DID 
		ARRIVE  ACK=1,2,4,5

	3) IF A PACKET IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THEN SENDER
		MAY RESEND

	TCP : SLOW BUT CERTAIN DELIVERY

UDP

	Provides no checking and may be used if just 
	speed is required, but no certainty of checking.

	eg using an internet radio station or youtube

```

Layer 5 : Session Layer

```
Coordinate streams of data being sent to the computer

	5 BROWSER TABS AND EACH ONE : PLAY SAME YOUTUBE 
			VIDEO ON EACH TAB!!!

		Organise data to stream to correct tab...

```

Layer 6 : Presentation Layer

```
ENCRYPTION
		Plain text => cipher text

COMPRESSION 

		EG BMP OR RAW IMAGE ==> Compressed JPG		
		   WMA              ==> Compressed MP3
		   WMV              ==> Compressed MP4

```

Layer 7 : Application Layer

```
Program which requests access onto network eg Skype, Outlook..

```

Binary

```
bit		1 or 0
byte		8 bits 10101010
nibble          4 bits 1101

```

Networking Protocols

FTP
Port 20/21
File Transfer Protocol
Secure??? NO NO NO! Passwords PLAIN TEXT!!!

```
SFTP	encrypt over SSH secure shell  Port 22
FTPS	encrypt over SSL               Port 443

```

Bittorrent

```
CARE CARE CARE!!!  VIRUS ALERT!!!

Takes a large file and splits it into 'seeds'.

	Each seed gets downloaded, but also if you enable
	it, your computer can now sent seeds to other
	computers which need it.

	==> DISTRIBUTED FILE SHARING

		(Much more efficient)

```

Telnet
Port 23
Earliest days of computing : control another computer
across internet using command line

```
	PLAIN TEXT : NOT SECURE

```

SSH Secure Shell
Port 22
Encrypted Telnet

Email
SEND
SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Port 25
Plain text : insecure by default

```
RECEIVE

	POP
		Port 110
		Simple version

	IMAP
		Port 143
		Complex version eg multiple email clients

```

HTTP
Plain text web page
Port 80

HTTPS
Encrypted web page
Port 443
Protocols to encrypt : SSL and TLS (newer version of SSL)

DNS
Domain Name System
Maps name to IP eg [bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk/) to 1.2.3.4
Port 53

DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Port 67
Allocate IP to computer

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol
Log in to server remotely
Port 3389

```
==> KNOW THOSE PORTS ABOVE!!!

```

ICMP : Error message protocol for internet eg 404 unreachable

```
PING : (echo request) member of ICMP family

```

SNMP : Simple Network Management Protocol
Manage network of many devices : routers, switches, printers,
servers.

```
	1) Heartbeat message 30/60secs : Know machine is 
					reachable

	2) States eg Throughput MB per hour

```

NETBIOS
Port 137
Used HOSTNAME to do NETWORKING (before DNS)

```
	PC01		1.2.3.4
	PC02		5.6.7.8

```

TFTP : Trivial FTP : Across LAN to copy eg new OS to CISCO SWITCH
Port 69

DMZ : De-Militarized Zone ==== PERMIMETER NETWORK

```
Used to host a public server eg WWW.myshop.com or similar.
Even if it does get hacked, minimum loss to organisation
as can't hack into secure LAN from there

```

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
Join two LANs securely using one of 4 encryption protocols

PPP : Create the dial up session (not encrypted)
	Point-to-point protocol : simply dials up and
				  creates the connection	

PPTP : Original Microsoft (not very secure)
	Point-to-point Tunneling Protocol
	PORT 1723

L2TP : Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
	Good, slow? from XP onwards...
	PORT 1701

SSTP : Uses Port 443 (HTTPS) which is already open
	(Secure Sockets Tunneling Protocol)

IKEV2 : Windows 7 onwards : has auto-reconnect if eg
		your wifi / 4g signal drops

```

VLAN
Virtual LAN

```
In order to keep departments separate we must create
VLANS which group SWITCH PORTS.

PORT		VLAN

1		VLAN01
2		VLAN01	
3		VLAN01       ports 1,2,3 can see each other

4		VLAN02
5		VLAN02
6		VLAN02	    ports 4,5,6 can see each other

EVERY PACKED GETS 'TAGGED' WITH THE VLANID ADDED
	TO EACH PACKET

```

Encryption (page 28)

```
CRYPTOGRAPHY = SCIENCE OF ENCRYPTION

ALGORITHM = PROGAM TO DO THE ENCRYPTION EG MD5/SHA1/RSA/AES ETC

KEY can be used by the ALGORITHM

PLAIN 
TEXT  ==> ALGORITHM  +  KEY  ==> CIPHER TEXT OUT
IN		

abc					d5d

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
USED A) WIFI
     B) WINDOWS NTFS ENCRYPTION!!!

WIFI

	ORIGINAL MESSAGE ==> ENCYPT WITH WPA2 USING AES
				ENCRYPTION + WIFI KEY

				==> ENCRYPTED MESSAGE (SEND)

	DECRYPT MESSAGE AT OTHER END USING AES + SAME WIFI KEY

	==> INSECURE AS SAME KEY BOTH ENCRYPT & DECRYPT SO 
			QUITE 'HACKABLE'

	EXAM : OLD WEP ENCRYPTION NO LONGER USED AS 'HACKED'
	       CURRENT 
			WPA USING TKIP ENCYRPTION JUST OK
			WPA2      AES                OK (GOOD)

	OLDER SYMMETRIC PROTOCOLS : DES/3DES/BLOW/TWOFISH

WINDOWS ENCRYPTION

	SAME THING BUT  

		==> YOUR PASSWORD IS THE KEY THIS TIME!!!

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION : SUMMARY : ONE KEY TO ENCRYPT AND 
			DECRYPT EG WIFI USING WPA2 & AES.

```

ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION = 'HASHING'

```
www.sha1-online.com

MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE UNHACKABLE IE CANNOT FIND 
	REVERSE PASSWORD 

	==> HACKERS RESORT TO USING 'RAINBOW TABLES' WHICH
		ARE PRE-COMPUTED TABLES OF KNOWN PASSWORDS

WHY USE HASHES??
	
HASHES CAN REPRESENT FILES OR STRINGS UNIQUELY

	STRING  ==>  HASH

	FILE    ==>  HASH    

			CHANGE INPUT THEN OUTPUT HASH WILL
			CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

	phil	e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

	phil + space  

		328368f5069ffc3dedd5b02e6347174e8aedeb22

```

PKI PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY ENCRYPTION

```
TWO KEYS ARE ISSUED

	PRIVATE (KEPT SECURE)

	PUBLIC (GIVEN TO ANYONE)

ENCRYPT WITH ONE ==> DECRYPT WITH OTHER (WORKS BOTH WAYS)

PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE AND ROCK SOLID => COURTS OF LAND
			WOULD ACCEPT AS EVIDENCE

THREE USES:

1)  ALICE SENDS BOB A FILE AND ONLY BOB TO READ FILE

	ALICE ENCRYPTS FILE WITH BOB'S PUBLIC KEY (ANYONE
			CAN GET HOLD OF)
	SEND TO BOB
	BOB USES HIS PRIVATE KEY TO UNLOCK AND READ

2) COMMAND HQ SENDS ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO ALL PERSONNEL.
	PEOPLE WANT TO VERIFY IT'S GENUINE.

	HQ WILL ENCRYPT WITH HQ PRIVATE KEY
	RECIPIENTS CAN UNLOCK WITH HQ PUBLIC KEY, THEREFORE
		CAN BE CONFIDENT IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM HQ
		AND NO-ONE ELSE

```

Chapter 1 : General Terms

Risk

```
Science of looking at all possibilities 

	Threat : to organisation

		Internal
		External
		Man-made
		Natural

	Vulnerability : can be exploited by attacker

	Risk : % chance (high/med/low) that a
		vulnerability in our system will
		be exploited

		POT HOLES IN ROAD

			SMALL ==> ZERO CHANCE OF CLAIM

			UNATTENDED .. POT WILL GROW

			CHANCE WILL GROW OF CLAIM 

			DO NOTHING : CERTAIN AT SOME
				POINT SOMEONE WILL CLAIM

Intrusion

Attack

```

CIA

```
CONFIDENTIALITY

	ENCRYPT DATA

INTEGRITY

	CAN TRUST THE DATA WE USE

	COURSE : INTEGRTITY ==> HASHING OF DATA AND FILES

		FILE1 ==> 'HASH' (MD5/SHA1) ==>
	
			FIXED LENGTH STRING WHICH 'REPRESENTS'
				FILE

			((CHECK HASH BEFORE AND AFTER))

AVAILABILITY

	DATA MUST BE AVAILABLE (TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
		SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY)

```

NON-REPUDIATION

```
CANNOT DENY ELECTRONICALLY THAT A TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE

WAY WE DO THIS IS A FOLLOWS : 

	1) GET YOUR FILES AND/OR LOGS OF TRANSACTION 

	2) PUT THEM TOGETHER AND ZIP INTO ONE UNIT

	3) TAKE HASH OF ZIP FILE

	4) USING PKI PRIVATE KEY, WE NOW ENCRYPT 
		ONLY THE HASH OF THE TRANSACTION

		(( THIS ENCRYPTED HASH OF A TRANSACTION IS
		   CALLED THE 'SIGNATURE' OF TRANSACTION))

		  UNIQUE !!!

	5) THIS IS 'ROCK SOLID' AND VERIFIABLE IN A COURT 
		OF LAW - BUT HOW???

		==> TAKE PUBLIC KEY OF SIGNATORY AND USE
		    THIS TO DECRYPT THE HASH.

		    TAKE ZIP FILE ==> GET FRESH HASH
		    COMPARE FRESH HASH WITH DECRYPTED HASH

			==> HASHES MUST MATCH

```

AUTHENTICATION

```
PROVIDE CREDENTIALS AND LOG IN

SOMETHING YOU KNOW : PASSWORD  /   PIN NUMBER

SOMETHING YOU HAVE : SMART / CAC / ATM CARD

SOMETHING YOU ARE  : FINGERPRINT/EYE/VOICE/RETINA

SOMEWHERE YOU ARE  : GEOLOCATION EG IP ADDRESS OR SATNAV
					COORDINATES

SOMETHING YOU DO   : WAY YOU TYPE (KEYSTOKE PATTERN)

```

AUTHORISATION

```
PERMISSIONS YOU RECEIVE AFTER LOGIN

NOTE : 

	FAT32 SMARTPHONE CARD ==> ZERO PERMISSIONS
	NTFS  WINDOWS : FINE PERMISSIONS TO GRANT/DENY ACCESS

MAC MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL

	BOOK : HIGH SECURITY DOCUMENTS (PERHAPS GOVERNMENT
		CLASSIFIED)

		EXAM : TRIGGER WORD : HIGHLY SECURE ....

		ACCESS IS ??? SET IN LAW ??? AND NOT
			NEGOTIABLE

DISCRETIONARY ACCESS

	DISCRETION ==> FREE TO CHOOSE

	WE CAN CREATE AND SET PERMISSIONS AS WE CHOOSE

ROLE BASED ACCESS

	CREATE A ROLE IN YOUR COMPANY EG ENGINEER

		NEW ENGINEER JOINS : AUTO-ADD TO A 				PREDETERMINED LIST OF GROUPS
			DEPEND ON ROLE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL

RULE BASED ACCESS

	EG TIMED ACCESS MIDNIGHT TO 6 : RUNNING BACKUP
		SO ALL USERS BANNED REGARDLESS OF 
		PERMISSION

```

IMPLICIT DENY

```
ALL USERS ARE BLOCKED ACCESS UNLESS EXPLIT PERMISSION
				IS GRANTED	

```

LEAST PRIVILEGE

```
GRANT MINIMUM PERMISSIONS ONLY

```

SEPARATION OF DUTIES

```
CLEARLY DEFINED JOB ROLES AND DUTIES	

```

THREAT
IF ONE PERSON ONLY IS A 'SPECIALIST' THERE ARE TWO RISKS
A) INSIDER HACKING THAT NO-ONE KNOWS ABOUT
B) LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE IF THEY LEAVE

JOB ROTATION

```
EVERY 2/3 MONTHS MOVING INDIVIDUALS TO NEW JOB ROLE : 
	KEEP INFORMATION FRESH AND CURRENT AND WITH
	MULTIPLE PEOPLE

```

MANDATORY VACATION

```
FORCE TO TAKE HOLIDAY EG 1/2 WEEKS BLOCK AT A TIME

```

ORPHAN ACCOUNT

```
FOLDER CREATED BY USER THEN THAT USER IS DELETED!!!

NO OWNER!!!

```

PMI : PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

```
ORGANISATION WHICH TAKES SECURITY SERIOUSLY AND MANAGES
PERMISSIONS ACCORDINGLY

```

AUTHENTICATION

```
USER/PASS

SMART CARD  : HOLD 'TOKEN' OR 'KEY' OR 'PRIVATE KEY' OF
	A CERTIFICATE

	EG ATM, CAC CARD

BIOMETRIC

	FINGERPRINT/EYE SCAN=RETINA SCAN/VOICE RECOGNITION

GEOLOCATION

	GPS COORDINATES

	OR USE YOUR ROUTER'S PUBLIC IP ==> ISP LOCATION

		ISP INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER => PROVIDE
				INTERNET

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

	USE EG 1) USER/PASSWORD
	       2) SMART CARD
	       3) IP ADDRESS    TO LOG IN

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION

	SERVERS MUST AUTHENTICATE EACH OTHER!!!

	USE 'CERTIFICATES' AND 'DIGITALLY SIGNING' OUR
	CERTIFICATE TO PRESENT OUR CERTIFICATE TO THE
	OTHER SERVER FOR VERIFICATION.

		==> TRUST PROVIDER OF CERTIFICATE EG
			VERISIGN ==> THEN TRUST COMPUTER
			IS BONA-FIDE COMPUTER

	802.1X ==> PERMIT SERVERS TO AUTOMATICALLY 
		   AUTHENTICATE EACH OTHER IN BACKGROUND

```

CRYPTOGRAPHY = ENCRYPTION

```
WAYS TO ENCRYPT DATA

	STREAM CIPHER
	
		FAST BUT LESS SECURE!

		ONE CHARACTER ONLY GETS ENCRYPTED AT A TIME

			A  	=> 	Y
			B	=>	I
			C	=>	8

	BLOCK CIPHER		

		TAKES GROUP OF CHARACTERS EG 100 AT A TIME
		ENCRYPT THEM AS A BLOCK

		MUCH MORE SECURE, MUCH HARDER TO CRACK

		SLOWER!!!

SPEED OF ENCRYPTION

	SYMMETRIC

		FAST ==> CAN DO REAL-TIME

			WIFI
			SHORT-TERM 'SESSION' EG BANKING
				SESSION FOR 10 MINUTES			

	ASYMMETRIC

		ROCK-SOLID!
		VERY SLOW!!!

	HASHING : NOT REAL TIME EITHER 

```

## STEGANOGRAPHY

```
HIDING ENCRYPTED DATA INSIDE EG IMAGE/MUSIC FILE/VIDEO FILE
SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT UNWANTED ATTENTION THAT THIS IS 
SENSITIVE DATA

```

OTP ONE TIME PAD

```
PASSWORD VALID FOR ONE TIME ONLY (EG TEXT CODE SENT TO YOUR
		PHONE)

TOTP  TIME-BASED OTP VALID FOR EG 10 MINUTES ONLY

```

HASHING

```
sha1-online.com

EXAM : ALGORITHMS USED

	1. MD5  (OLD)

	2. SHA1 (US GOVT APPROVED)

	3. RACE / RIPEMD  ==> SIMPLE TEXT-BASED HASHING

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
EXAM : TYPES USED

	AES : CURRENT, STRONG ENCRYPTION

	TKIP : OLDER, VISTA (WIFI)

	DES  : ORIGINAL , OLD NOW
	3DES : DES THREE TIMES OVER
	BLOW/TWO FISH

```

ASYMMETRIC TYPES

```
RSA 
DH   DIFFIE HELLMAN
ECC
DHE  : USING 'TEMPORARY' = 'EPHEMERAL' KEY

				TEMPORARY = EPHEMERAL

```

KEY EXCHANGE : SHARING KEYS BETWEEN USERS

DIGITAL SIGNATURE : FILE ==> 1) HASH FILE 2) ENCRYPT THE HASH USING
OUR PRIVATE KEY

```
	    OTHERS VERIFY BY DECRYPTING WITH OUR PUBLIC KEY
		AND COMPARING HASH OF FILE VS STATED HASH

```

SESSION KEY

```
SHORT TERM (FAST) SYMMETRIC KEY USED FOR REAL-TIME
	COMMUNICATIONS

	EG HTTPS COMMUNICATIONS

	
((PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY : CANNOT WORK OUT PREVIOUS
	SESSIONS IF CURRENT SESSION KEY GETS 
	REVEALED)))

```

SHORT PASSWORDS!!! ARE A BIG PROBLEM !!!

KEY STRETCHING ===> ADDING CHARACTERS TO A SHORT PASSWORD
AUTOMATICALLY TO MAKE IT MORE SECURE

```
BCRYPT USED FOR THIS

```

	WHAT CHANGE IS PROPOSED?

	HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?

	MAN HOURS???

	PLANNED DOWNTIME ???

	RISKS INVOLVED?? IF SO, RISK ANALYSIS?

	3. GATEWAY     (YOUR OWN PRIVATE ROUTER ON YOUR LAN)
	4. DNS

GATEWAY = COMPUTER ON OUR LAN THROUGH WHICH ALL INTERNET
		TRAFFIC MUST PASS

SINKHOLE ==> IN WIFI, SETTING UP FAKE GATEWAY SO 
	INTERNET TRAFFIC GOING THROUGH BOGUS GATEWAY

		EG HACK INTO DHCP ==> GET DHCP TO GIVE
			OUT A FAKE GATEWAY ADDRESS

WPS : ONE-BUTTON AUTO-SETUP OF HOME WIFI

NAS DRIVE 

	USE FOR 'SOHO' SMALL-OFFICE HOME-OFFICE

			(LESS THAN 10 USERS)

	USING RAID 5 TO STORE FILES

		
		RAID 0 STRIPING : VERY FAST : BUT
			 PROBLEM IF ONE DRIVE FAILS YOU
			 LOSE ALL YOUR DATA
		RAID 1 MIRRORING OF 2 DRIVES 
		RAID 5 3+ DRIVES WITH FAULT TOLERANCE : 
			IF ONE DRIVE FAILS THE DATA IS

PROBLEM!!!  OUR HARD DRIVES BOOT USING MBR MASTER
		BOOT RECORD TALKING TO BIOS/CMOS
		CHIPS ON OUR COMPUTER

		THESE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT UNDERSTAND 			ENCRYPTION!!!

SO TO GET BITLOCKER TO WORK WE MUST SPLIT OUR HARD DRIVE

DATA DISPOSAL

```
MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE RESTORED BY CROOKS IF WE DISPOSE
	OF IT CASUALLY.  STRICT POLICIES EXIST TO 
	ENFORCE CORRECT METHOD OF 'DISPOSING' OF DATA

1. WIPE OUR HARD DRIVE WITH RANDOM DATA 7 TIMES OVER

	(( THINK MUDDY FIELD : DRIVE 100 CARS ROUND 
		FIELD 10 MINUTES : ERASE ORIGINAL 
		TRACKS ))

2. DEGAUSS : TAKE A MAGNET AND WIPE DRIVE

3. PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION EG HAMMER OR PHYSICALLY SHRED DRIVE

```

HARDENING YOUR SERVER

```
HARDEN SERVER = INCREASE SECURITY

BASELINE = ORIGINAL SETTINGS

	HARDEN ==> CREATE NEW BASELINE FOR HARDENED SERVER

GET BASICS RIGHT

	UPDATES FOR SERVER : ON
	UPDATES FOR AV SOFTWARE : ON
	UPDATES FOR APPLICATIONS : PATCH MANAGEMENT : ON

```

ALPHA TEST : INITIAL RELEASE TO CHOSEN INDIVIDUALS FOR TESTING
	EG JOURNALISTS, DEDICATED AUDIENCE

BETA TEST : FINAL RELEASE, FREE, SO PEOPLE CAN TEST IT FOR 
		YOU (THEY GET FREE GAME!) 

FUZZ TEST : THROW RANDOM DATA AT APPLICATION : DOES IT

```

PROXY SERVER

```
USED IN BIG COMPANIES FOR MANY REASONS : 

1) SECURITY : USING DIFFERENT IP THAN REAL GATEWAY

2) CACHING : SPEED OF DATA : STORE COPIES OF FILES ETC
			ON LOCAL LAN PROXY SERVER. 
			CLIENTS GET FASTER ACCESS

3) FILTERING : WHITELIST (GOOD SITES) /BLACKLIST (BLOCKED
			SITES)

4) USER ACTIVITY : KNOW WHICH USERS ONLINE, HOW LONG, WHICH

CONNECTION-LESS FIREWALL  (LAYER 3)

	CONNECTION-LESS DATA HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF FLOW
	OF DATA BEFORE OR AFTER

CONNECTION-ORIENTED FIREWALL  (LAYER 4)

	TCP : CHECKS FLOW

	CONNECTION-ORIENTED : AWARE OF FLOW OF DATA

APPLICATION-LEVEL FIREWALL  (LAYER 7)

	DEEP PACKET INSPECTION : LOOKING IN DETAIL
	AT CONTENTS OF PACKETS...

MOBILE SECURITY IS A 'HOT' ISSUE - WHY???

BYOD : BRING OWN DEVICE : PEOPLE USING PERSONAL DEVICES

	SECURITY RISK WITH COMPANY SENSITIVE INFO ON DEVICE
	WHICH IS 

	A) PERSONALLY OWNED
	B) NOT LOCKED DOWN
	C) NO CONTROL OVER OTHER APPS INSTALLED, IF THEY

Risk

```
Risk Analysis Process

	1. IDENTIFY YOUR ASSETS

		Equipment of value
		Data ==> OF HIGHEST VALUE EVEN THOUGH
			MAYBE CAN'T PUT PRICE ON IT!
		People 
			Knowledge and Experience of 
			key personnel
		Building

	   EXAM : AV ==> ASSET VALUE
	
	2. Identify Vulnerabilities / Weaknesses

	3. Identify Threats (Internal/External/Man-made/
				Natural)

	4. Probability Chart 

		% likelihood that a particuar threat
			will materialise and threaten
			a vulnerability

			eg 10% chance pothole x in road y
			       will generate an insurance
			       claim

		SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY

			$$$COST OF ONE OCCURRENCE		

		ARO ANNUAL RATE OF OCCURRENCE

			PREDICTED NUMBER OF TIMES A YEAR
			THIS WILL HAPPEN

		ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY

			$$$EXPECTED LOSSES IN 1 YEAR				

	5. IMPACT ANALYSIS : LOOKING AT COSTS ABOVE OR
		OTHER EVENTS WHICH CAN'T BE MEASURED
		WITH MONEY EG LOSS OF MORALE, MOTIVATION,
		LOSS OF FACE, LOSS OF REPUTATION ETC ...
	

	6. WHAT DO WE DO??? 

		NOTHING  IE LIVE WITH RISK (EG CROSSING ROAD)
	
		INSURE (TRANSFER) OUR RISK BY INSURING
			AGAINST LOSS EG FOOTBALLER INSURE
					LEG

		PUT UP WARNING SIGNS AS DETERRENCE TO 
			ATTACKERS : PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
		
		AVOID THE RISK ALTOGETHER BY DOING SOMETHING
			ELSE (DON'T CROSS THE ROAD BUT USE
				THE TUNNEL!)

		SPEND SOME MONEY OR TAKE ACTION

			"MITIGATION" => TAKE ACTION TO 
					MINIMISE OUR LOSS

			EG CREATE POLICIES, BUILD DEFENCES,
			   EDUCATE USERS, ADVICE FROM EXPERTS,
			   TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST
			   POTENTIAL ATTACKER
			   
			   
ATTACK SURFACE ==> SOMETHING IN WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED TO 
			A THREAT

HONEYPOT

	DECOY TO DISTRACT ATTACKER 1) THEY ARE DISTRACTED
				   2) WE CAN PERHAPS MONITOR
					  THEM
HONEYNET

	WHOLE NETWORK OF DISTRACTION

```

Scanning for vulnerabilities

```
Enemy may do the following : 

	Footprinting : use common sense methods to try and
			gain info on you.  Using methods
			which may be legal eg public 
			birth/death/marriage records, 
			public accounts records, website info

	Enumerating : Using illegal methods to gain further
		      detailed info about you.

		      EG  COMPANY : DOING PORT SCANS, 
			   HACKING IN AND GETTING NETWORK INFO,
			   IP INFO, PORT INFO, SERVER NAME 
			   INFO, NAMES OF KEY PEOPLE WHO
	
			Personal level : credit card info,
				security answers to questions

You may do the following

	Vulnerability Scan

	Port scan

	Deep-level test to try and penetrate your network
			eg using ethical hackers etc

```

INVESTIGATING A CRIME

	1. LOOK AT ANYTHING 'VOLATILE'  <<VOLATILITY>>

		TURN OFF ==> INFO DISAPPEARS

		EG  CONTENTS OF RAM OR PAGE FILES ETC

	2. HARD DRIVE : TAKE IMAGE STRAIGHT AWAY

		SIGN/HASH IMAGE 

	3. CREATE A 'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'

		SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR
		EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES

```

DISASTER RECOVERY

```
FAULT TOLERANCE = RECOVERY FROM FAULT

	EG RAID 5  :   DRIVE FAILS ==> STILL SURVIVE
	   CLUSTER :   SERVER FAILS ==> GO TO SERVERB

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE = ONE THING WHICH, IF IT BREAKS, 
		MAKES YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM FAIL (EG YOUR BRAIN!)

	ROUTER : GATEWAY : TO INTERNET
	SWITCH : CENTRAL POINT OF NETWORK

BCP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN : WRITTEN PLAN FOR ACTIVITY
		IN CERTAIN EVENTS EG WEBSITE GETS HACKED.

BIA BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS : WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THREAT
		X MATERIALIZES (IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS)

MTD MAX TOLERABLE DOWNTIME

	EG IF SERVER GOES DOWN, IT MUST BE UP WITHIN 2 DAYS	

RPO : RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

	HOW FREQUENT ARE YOUR BACKUPS???
	IF DISASTER, HOW MUCH DATA ARE YOUR PREPARED TO LOSE?
	EG EVERY 4 HOURS YOU BACKUP, THEN POTENTIALLY
	ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE 4 HOURS WORTH OF DATA?

RTO RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE : PLANNED TIME BY WHICH WE 
	HAVE FIXED AN ITEM AND GET EVERYTHING WORKING

```

HOT/WARM/COLD SITE

```
HOT SITE : 100% READY TO GO - COMPUTERS, NETWORK

		*** TOO COSTLY ! ***

WARM SITE : PCS THERE, SHUT DOWN.  1-2 DAYS TO GET SET 
	UP, RESTORE BACKUPS, BEGIN WORK.

		*** HIGH BUT REASONABLE COST **

COLD SITE : JUST BARE SHELL OF BUILDING WITH WATER AND
		ELECTRICITY AND LITTLE ELSE

	1-2 WEEKS TO SET UP

```

MTTF MEAN TIME TO FAIL = AVERAGE TIME BEFORE EG HARD DRIVE FAIL (3 YEARS)

```
==> MTBF MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES

```

MTTR MEAN TIME TO REPAIR : AVERAGE TIME TO FIX EG SERVER

Networking

OSI 7 Layer Model

Physical
Data Link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application

Physical : Layer 1

Cabling

```
Copper

	TP Twisted Pair : 8 cables in 4 pairs

		UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair
		STP Shielded Twisted Pair

	Plenum  : fire rated cable (longer before burns)

		USED TO STOP FIRE SPREADING BETWEEN BUILDINGS 

	
	COAX
		THICKNET = 10BASE5 = RG8

			ORIGINAL : FIRST CABLE : ROBUST (500M)
			10BASE5  (speed 10Mbps, length 500m)

					Mbps Mega BITS PER SECOND
					(MB  Mega BYTES STORAGE)
			RG8

		THINNET = 10BASE2 = RG58

			10base2 : Speed 10Mbps, Length 200m (185m)
			Used for TV today

		
	Connectors
		RJ45	Network
		RJ11	Phone

		BNC		(coax)
		F-Connector	(coax)   *** NOT FIBER!!! **

Fiber
	Single Mode (Mono mode) - Pure laser light : 50km

	Multi Mode : cheaper : LED light : 2km
		Better for city-wide networks
			MAN Metropolitan Area Network
			CAN Campus Area Network (university)

			(((   LAN local
    			      WAN wide : long distance
			      PAN personal : bluetooth direct 
						communication)))

```

Layer 1 Devices

```
Hub  :   DEAL WITH ELECTRICITY ONLY IE SIGNAL IN ==> SIGNAL
		BROADCAST OUT ON ALL OTHER PORTS (INEFFICIENT)

Repeater : 2-port hub

	Used to EXTEND ETHERNET from 100m (max) to 200m

	|---------100m-----|repeater|--------100m---------|

```

Layer 1 summary : ANYTHING YOU CAN TOUCH!
CABLING : COPPER : UTP/STP
COAX THICKNET/THINNET
FIBER MONOMODE (LASER) 50KM
MULTIMODE (LED) 2KM
HUB
REPEATER

```
Port included also : physically plug cables in

```

Exam Topics

```
UTP Unshielded so VULNERABLE TO EMI interference  (RFI radio)
				and EAVESDROPPING (listen in)
COAX : Natural shield on outside so protected

FIBER : ZERO INFLUENCE FROM RFI/EMI radiation

```

Layer 2 : Data Link

```
GETTING DATA ROUND OUR LOCAL LAN!!!

PC------------SWITCH----------PC

EVERY DEVICE HAS UNIQUE ADDRESS ==> MAC Address

	IPCONFIG => SHOW IP
	IPCONFIG /ALL ==> SHOW MAC
	GETMAC
				
	18-66-DA-3E-0A-C8

	FIRST HALF = OUI = COMPANY WHICH MADE CARD  18-66-DA

	  (Google 'oui' +  18-66-DA)

Sending Data on LAN

	Ethernet is the 'protocol' to TRANSPORT DATA
			
		Ethernet 'frame' = packet of data

	|Preamble|Dest MAC |Source MAC | DATA | CRC Error check|

	Preamble ==> get ready, clocks sync ==> data is arriving!

	
Switch

	Examine 'source' and 'destination' MAC 

	Build table of attached PCs

	Port		MAC
	1		aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff
	2		..

	SWITCH will connect computers 1-1 (very fast)

			
Layer 2 summary
	SWITCH links computers using MAC ADDRESS
	DATA sent using ETHERNET 	

```

Layers 3 : Network

```
Layer 1 : Physical : cabling
Layer 2 : LOCAL LAN : MAC : ETHERNET : SWITCH
Layer 3 : Global Addressing with IP

Private IP

	FREE!!!

	4 ranges
		10.x.y.z			CLASS A
		172.16.x.y - 172.31.x.y RANGE         B
		192.168.x.y			      C

		169.254.x.y	==> APIPA Automatic Private IP
							Address
				((DHCP broken so you get this 
						instead))		

	Private IP ==> BANNED FROM INTERNET!!!

Public IP

	PAID!!!  $5/month!
	
	Google 'whatismyip'    147.35.10.33

	5 ranges		
	  Class A	1-126   (looking at FIRST NUMBER ONLY)		
		Loopback  127.0.0.1  (Test Network card working)
			PING 127.0.0.1 = 
			PING localhost = 
			PING ::1
	        B	128-191 
                C	192-223 
	        D	224-239 	MULTICAST : SEND DATA TO 
					GROUP OF COMPUTERS
		E	240-255 

Subnet Mask

	Can be used to tell which computers are on SAME NETWORK

	IP	192		168		10 		20
	MASK	255		255		255		0		        MASK 	11111111	11111111	11111111    00000000
	(binary)					 ^^
							split
	Mask : SPLIT IP INTO TWO PARTS

		Left : Network ID		    Right : Host ID
		          192.168.10			20
		All computers on same network
		have SAME NETWORK ID

	CLASS A/B/C MASK
		CLASS A		255.0.0.0
		      B		255.255.0.0
		      C		255.255.255.0

Summary so far : Layer 3 gives us an IP ADDRESS to enable 
		GLOBAL COMMUNICATION

	ping facebook.com ==> 31.13.91.36  actually facebook lives
					   on this IP!!!!

```

Routing (Still layer 3!!!)

```
So far : IP Provides ADDRESSING GLOBALLY

Also : ROUTING create BEST PATHS ACROSS INTERNET!!!

	HERE ==> CHINA : pre-create ROUTES beforehand!!!

		MEASURE DISTANCE IN 'HOPS' ( ONE ROUTER TO NEXT)
					MAX HOPS : 31

			((TTL TIME TO LIVE = 31,30,29,...3,2,1,0
					((CEASE TO EXIST))

Routing : think building ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE IN COUNTRY

RIP Routing Internet Protocol (v2)

	Creates best routes
	HOP = DISTANCE (('metric'))	
	INEFFICIENT (( broadcasts all data every 30 seconds!!!))

EIGRP : by Cisco

	Same as RIP but
	1-1 updates (no broadcast)
	only send update if a change has happened!!!

OSPF	Open Shortest Path First
	Splits world into 'areas'   ((think sending a letter))
				 
		OSPF truly global : efficient

RIP, EIGRP	==> 'distance vector' protocols (measure by 'hops')
OSPF	        ==> 'link state' : use areas

```

Layer 4 : Transport

```
Layer 2 : LAN ADDRESSING (MAC)
Layer 3 : IP ADDRESSING

	Layer 3 is called 'connection-less' as it doesn't give us
			feedback on WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED!!!

TCP : Transmission Control Protocol

	Job : feedback on WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED!!!

	TCP counts packets out

		SEQ = SEQUENCE NUMBER = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7	

		RECEIVER : ALSO SENDS BACK AN 'ACKNOWLEDGEMENT' 
		
		ACK = PACKET RECEIVED OK = 1,2,3,4,6,7

		SENDER : READ 1,2,3,4,6,7 AND KNOW PACKET 5 WENT
				MISSING!!!

		SENDER : RESEND PACKET 5 AND GET ACK 5 BACK

			==> COMPLETE!!!  7 PACKETS SENT + RECEIVED					
	TCP = GUARANTEED DELIVERY  (CONNECTION-ORIENTED)

	TCP also begins all communication with 'TCP 3-WAY HANDSHAKE'

		1) Client : 'Hey server I've got data to send.
					Are you ready?'
		2) Server : 'Yes OK, ready'
		3) Client : 'OK let's begin'

```

Layer 5 : Session Layer

```
STREAMS OF TRAFFIC TO/FROM DEVICE

	Extreme: Youtube video in 5 tabs playing same video!!!
	Add in : Skype, Whatsapp ...

```

Layer 6 : Presentation

```
1) ENCRYPT DATA HERE  	EG  http ==> https encrypted traffic

		HTTP PORT 80
		HTTPS PORT 443

2) COMPRESSION eg large 'BMP' bitmap ==> small JPG (compressed)
			'WMV' video            MP4 

```

Layer 7 : Application Layer eg Skype, Outlook etc

Networking Ports

```
What is a port???

A port is a CHANNEL TO SEND DATA

Think : IP is like a MEDIEVAL CASTLE :  no way in or out unless
				via approved channel!

	Illustrate dictionary.com:80 works!
                                     :81 does not work!

Port numbers run from

	1 to 65536 !!!   (2^16)

	1 to 1000  common
	1000 - 49000 registered
	49000+  anyone can use!!!
		

		Note : kilo = 1000 but in binary we have 
			2x2x2x.. = 2^10 = 1024

		Use 1024 as approx 1000 in computing
		1KB - 1000 APPROX	1024		10^3
		1MB - MILLION APPROX	.....		10^6
		1GB - BILLION				10^9
		1TB - TERABTE				10^12
		1PB - PETABYTE				10^15

```

Common Ports!!!

```
FTP File Transfer Protocol
    20 DATA
        21 ADMIN

	PLAIN TEXT!!! NOT SECURE!!!

	SFTP	FTP OVER ...
	FTPS	FTP OVER ...

Torrent (Peer-to-peer)

	Better than FTP
	Splits large files into 'SEEDS'
	Also can upload our SEEDS TO OTHER PEOPLE!!! (distributed)
		** CARE !!! **
	

TELNET Terminal Emulation

	COMMAND LINE ACROSS THE INTERNET!!!
	NOT USED TODAY!!!
	Port 23

SSH Secure Shell
	Encrypted Telnet
	Port 22
	Used today (eg manage LINUX/IPHONE)

EMAIL
	OUT
		SMTP  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
		      Port 25	

	IN
		POP	Simple
			Port 110

		IMAP	Complex
			Port 143

HTTP	plain text 
	Port 80

HTTPS	encrypted
	Port 443
	Encrypted with SSL (old)  SECURE SOCKETS LAYER
		       TLS (upgrade) TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY

		Exam : assume BOTH ARE GOOD!!!
		       might get question : MUST BE AWARE TLS
			NEWER (FIXES FAULT IN SSL)
			
		Real life : SSL is 'deprecated' ((no longer 					officially supported))

DNS Domain Name System

	Like a phone book

	Name		IP
	facebook.com	31.13.91.36

	Port 53

	(( NSLOOKUP give DNS info   eg NSLOOKUP google.com ))

DHCP 	Give computer IP Address

	PC ====>> BROADCAST 'HELP! I NEED AN IP'

		 	<<============= DHCP SERVER : GIVES IP

	D	DISCOVER	CLIENT : HELP !  I NEED AN IP!!!
				         (BROADCAST)
	O	OFFER		SERVER : HERE IS ONE!
	R	REQUEST		CLIENT : OK FINE, I WILL TAKE IT!
	A	ACK (NOWLEDGE)	SERVER : DONE

	PORT 67/68

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol

	Log in to another computer remotely

	Port 3389

```

Harder Ports

```
HOSTNAME = NAME OF COMPUTER!

NETBIOS = DOING NETWORKING USING HOSTNAME ONLY!!!  (PRIMITIVE!)
	PORT 137-139

SNMP SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

	PORT 161-162
	50 ROUTERS -- ARE THEY ALL UP???  (ALIVE!)

		30 SECONDS ==> HEARTBEAT 'I AM ALIVE' SENT

```

Loopback 127.0.0.1
Class B  128-191
Class C  192-223
Class D	 224-239
Class E  240-255

```

Harder Network Concepts

```
ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

	NOTIFY USER IF FAULT EG
		404 Unreachable / Timeout / Invalid address etc

	Client ============================>> fail!!!

		<<<---------------ICMP LET YOU KNOW!!!!	

TFTP Trivial FTP

	Copy files on LAN 
	EG Cisco router : New operating system
	Port 69

DMZ De-Militarized Zone

	Host PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE on OUTSIDE OF OUR LAN

	PUBLIC
	WEB
	SERVER--------------------
				ROUTER

     				SECURE LAN

VPN Virtual Private Network

	Tunnel through the internet

	PPP ==> Dials up : Creates connection (point-to-point 							     protocol)
	
	4 Secure protocols:

	PPTP		Point-to-point tunnel	OLD!
			Port 1723

	L2TP/IPSEC	Layer 2 Tunneling 
			STRONG!  Certificates!
			Port 1701

	SSTP		Secure Sockets Tunneling
			VPN over HTTPS
			Port 443

	IKEV2		Strong!
			Ports 500, 4500  UDP
			
			VPN Reconnect!!!  Auto-reconnect within
			30 minutes (eg if on WIFI)

```

Switch

```
1 port typically runs at 1GBPS  (giga bits per second)

We can STACK THE SWITCHES!

	JOIN THEM ==> TRUNK PORT (10Gbps)
		      (UPLINK PORT)

	SWITCH1
            |     |
	|     |
	SWITCH2
		Loops !!!  Cause problems!!!
		STP Spanning Tree Protocol ==> AUTO BLOCKS LOOPS

```

VLAN Virtual LAN

```
Split up a SWITCH into SMALLER LANS - each one is SEPARATE 
	from the other

802.1Q  ==> OFFICIAL NAME

We can 'tag' each packet with the VLAN ID eg VLAN01, VLAN02 ETC

```

Encryption

```
Cryptography = science of encryption

ALGORITHM = Program (fixed) which encrypts data eg AES, DES, RCA

KEY = something UNIQUE WHICH CHANGES EVERY TIME SO OUTCOME OF
		ENCRYPTION IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT

Plain  ==>  algorithm   +   key                 ==> Cipher text
text						    (encrypted)

PLUS!!! Extra strength we add second key called 'salt'

	    algorithm   +   key    + salt (random
				     extra password)
				       (Exam:BCRYPT)

	      AES          wifi key  + salt (auto 
					generated)

```

3 types of encryption

```
1) 	SYMMETRIC

2) 	ASYMMETRIC

3) 	HASHING

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
FAST!
NOT VERY SECURE!
USED VERY OFTEN  
	A) WIFI
	B) HTTPS:// BROWSING
	
WIFI

PLAIN 
TEXT		AES		WIFI KEY	SALT     ENCRYPTED
							   DATA

ONE KEY DOES BOTH A) ENCRYPTION B) DECRYPTION !!!

	((ONE KEY DOING A LOT OF WORK ==> VULNERABLE!))

HOW CAN WE MAKE IT STRONGER???

	IF WE LIMIT THE TIME FOR EACH KEY TO 10 MINUTES THEN
	AN ATTACKER CAN'T BREAK IN DURING THIS TIME

	HTTPS:// USES THIS   :  CREATE 'SESSION' WHEN ONLINE

	CREATE FIRST KEY : LAST 10 MINUTES
	AFTER 10 MINUTES : RECREATE SECOND KEY ETC....
		KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU FINISH OR STOP USING SITE

WIFI ==> ONE KEY !!!  EASY TO HACK!

HTTPS ==> KEYS CHANGE 10 MINUTES ==> IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK

	= "SESSION KEY"

EXAM : WHICH PROTOCOLS????

	WIFI: 
		WEP			 WEP  : HACKED
		WPA OVER TKIP            TKIP : OK
		WPA2 OVER AES		 AES  : EXAM : GOOD ANSWER!

	NOT WIFI!

		DES
		3DES	(USE DES THREE TIMES!)
		BLOWFISH
		TWOFISH

		AES!!!    KING!!! GO FOR THIS IF NOT SURE!!

	NOTE
		CCMP UPGRADE TO AES

SYMMETRIC SUMMARY
	FAST BUT LESS SECURE
	ONE KEY : ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT
	AES AND CCMP BEST; OLDER ARE DES, 3DES, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH

```

ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
Uses two keys

Private and public

	Any can encrypt; other will decrypt

Rock solid !!! Web ACTUALLY RELIES ON THIS !!!

	Example : Verisign certificate : 30 years!!!

Super slow!!  But very secure!!!

Example :   Bob send Joe an encrypted file that only Joe can open

	1) Joe has PUBLIC KEY : SEND TO BOB (OK AS KEY IS PUBLIC)

	2) Bob : Encrypt file using JOE'S PUBLIC KEY

	3) Bob : Send to Joe

	4) Joe : Decrypt as he has the matching (PRIVATE) KEY to
			unlock the file

Hashing

```
ONE WAY ENCRYPTION

Phil	Hash ==> d14ffd41334ec4b4b3f2c0d55c38be6f

					sha1-online.com		

Phil.		dcd4936713c27cae72c65e90c1e60a66
Phil,		660005620824c23f08bc0bf9b6025ac8
Phil<space>	fdcffb2dda54dff940c0a541f1cee85c

	EASILY SPOT IF FILE HAS CHANGED!!!

	DATA INTEGRITY ==> ENSURE SOURCE FILE IS NOT CORRUPT!!!

Hashing => INTEGRITY CHECK

MD5	OLDER
SHA1	NEWER

SHA256		real life (not exam)
SHA512 

phil	SHA1	e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

```
SUMMARY : HASHING : ONE-WAY (CAN'T GO BACK!)

		MD5 OK
		SHA1 BETTER

Rainbow Table

	Bad guys : can't get back original password from hash!!!
		
	Instead : collect known passwords + hashes into huge tables
		(50GB) ==> so don't use short passwords!!!

```

SIGNING A FILE

```
1) HASH FILE
2) PRIVATE KEY : ENCRYPT THE HASH

	THIS 'ENCRYPTED HASH' WE CALL THE 'SIGNATURE' OF FILE.

		IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE : USE TO VERIFY FILE IS GENUINE

TO USE / VALIDATE A SIGNED FILE/DRIVER/PROGRAM

1) GET PUBLIC KEY OF THE 'SIGNER' AND USE IT TO DECRYPT THE HASH
2) TAKE A FRESH HASH
	FILE ==> HASH (AGAIN)
	DECRYPTED HASH ==> SHOULD MATCH 

USE THIS EVERYWHERE!!!  APPLE, MICROSOFT ALL USE 'SIGNED 			DRIVERS/APPS' ON ALL COMPUTERS

```

Chapter 1 : General Terms

```
C	Confidentiality		ENCRYPT FILES
I	Integrity		FILES NOT CHANGED (PROVE WITH HASH)
A	Availability		DATA AVAILABLE!!!

A	Authentication		LOG IN : PROVE YOUR IDENTITY :
				PRESENT CREDENTIALS
A	Authorisation		PERMISSION TO REACH FILE/WEBSITE/
					DATABASE
				ACL : ACCESS CONTROL LIST : VIEW

Confidentiality

```
Steganography

	Hiding encrypted data within an image or music file etc

```

Non-repudiation

```
Repudiate	reject, deny a statement or that something
			happened

Non-repudiation	Cannot deny that a transaction has happened : 
			use certificates

```

How can we PROVE A TRANSACTION IS GENUINE???

```
Answer : 'SIGN' the transaction files

	$1,000,000 database transaction
	Want to PROVE IT'S VALID BEYOND DOUBT
	1) Add timestamp 
	2) ZIP up database transaction files + timestamp
	3) ZIP ==> now 'sign it'

		a) HASH IT
		b) ENCRYPT HASH WITH OUR PRIVATE KEY

	Court case : prove genuine (later on!)

	1) ZIP ==> TAKE FRESH HASH
	2) COMPARE : FRESH HASH WITH OLD HASH
	3) OLD HASH : OBTAIN IT BY
		Decrypting the 'signed hash' with the signers
		PUBLIC KEY ==> REVEAL ORIGINAL HASH

		COMPARE OLD AND NEW HASH : SHOULD BE SAME!!!

```

Availability

```
Redundancy		Spare capacity to cope if there is a failure

Fault tolerance		System can keep running if there is a failure

```

Examples of Redundancy/Fault tolerance

```
Goal : AVOID 'SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE'

RAID

	Hard drives : build 'array'

		Example 'NAS drive'  NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE

	RAID 0	SUPER FAST !!!  BUT --> NO REDUNDANCY!!!
		"STRIPING"
		USE IT FOR SERVERS WHICH ARE PROCESSING DATA (NOT
		STORING IT)  EG FAST WEB/DATABASE SERVER

	RAID 1	Mirror	: Copy of one drive on the other : 2 drives

	RAID 5  Striping WITH PARITY 

		LINK N DRIVES

		3 MINIMUM TO WORK (32 MAX)

		ONE DRIVE FAILS ==> OTHERS KEEP DATA SAFE!!!

		COST : ONLY LOSE 1/N SPACE !!!  10 DRIVES COST 1/10
				IE 1 DRIVE)

	RAID 6	DOUBLE RAID 5 IE CAN LOSE 2 DRIVES AND STILL FUNCTION

			((4 DRIVES MIN))

	RAID 1-0  IS FAST RAID 0 BUT MIRROR EACH ARRAY, SO CAN
			ALSO HAVE REDUNDANCY  (SLOW!)

CLUSTERING

	SERVERA
	SERVERB
			SERVERA FAILS ==> SERVER B 'TAKE OVER'

				Services 'fail over' from A to B

			Fix A ==> 'Fail back' from B to A again

	Good for FRONT END SERVERS!!!  EG 24/7 CRITICAL SYSTEMS
		(MUST BE UP)

		
LOAD BALANCING

	

					1 4 7	BACK END SERVER
	CLIENT ----->	LOAD BALANCER	2 5 8	BACK END SERVER
					3 6 9	BACK END SERVER
						
						  (multiple servers
						  = server farm)

SITE REDUNDANCY

	USED IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES EG FIRE, FLOOD ETC

	HOT SITE	** EXPENSIVE !!! ** LIVE COPY OF OUR 
			SITE, FULLY UP AND RUNNING BUT NOBODY
			IS USING IT - IT'S SPARE!!	

	WARM SITE	BUILDING + COMPUTERS WITH SOFTWARE ETC,
			JUST NOT RUNNING 'LIVE'.  DISASTER 1/2 DAYS
			TO GET SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING

	COLD SITE	BARE BUILDING + ELECTRICITY + WATER: 1-2 				WEEKS TO GET UP AND RUNNING IN A DISASTER

POWER

	UPS	UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY
		BATTERY : LAST 30 MINUTES : POWER SERVERS
		IF ELECTRICITY FAILS.

	GENERATOR	HOSPITAL : LONG RUNNING POWER

HOT AISLE / COLD AISLE

	INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS 

		1. HVAC  : HEAT, VENTILATION, AIR CON
		2. SCADA : INDUSTRIAL EG POWER PLANT
	 		   SCADA = CONTROL PANEL TO RUN FACTORY		
	        3. DATACENTER

		
			HOT AIR/ COLD AIR TO FLOW EFFICIENTLY			
PATCHING SERVERS

	Server engineer : ensure 'patches' are current
		1) SECURITY ** CRITICAL **
		2) FEATURES : SOFTWARE IMPROVES, ADDS NEW FEATURES		

```

RISK

```
Vulnerability

	Weakness in your system

		Firewall : on and configured
		Disable OPEN PORTS 
		AV up to date 'update the signature'  (hashes
				of known viruses) ==> SCAN SYSTEM
				AND MATCH ALL HASHES OF OUR WHOLE
				COMPUTER TO SEE IF THEY MATCH
				ANY VIRUS HASHES!!!!
				** SIGNATURE-BASED SCANNING**
		PHYSICAL LOCK
		BIOS : ADMIN PASSWORD
		INFO : NEED TO KNOW!!!
		DISABLE USB/DVD ACCESS
		SWITCH : LOCK DOWN PORTS (BLOCK PORTS)
			802.1X ==> AUTOMATICALLY CHECK SYSTEMS
			       ARE VALID WHICH CONNECT
			(( LAYER 2 PORT SECURITY ))
		NO WEAK PASSWORDS

Threat
	
	Attacker!!!

Risk

	Chance that AN ATTACKER will EXPLOIT (USE) A VULNERABILITY
	(WEAKNESS) TO ATTACK US

	SLE	Single Loss Expectancy : $$$ expected if this
			particular event happens (loss)

	ARO 	Annual Rate of occurrence : HOW OFTEN EXPECT THIS 
			ATTACK

	ALE	= ANNUAL LOSS

	ALE	= SLE X ARO         

			EG $10,000 X TWICE YEAR ==> ANNUAL $20,000

	Mitigate 	Spend money to reduce chances of an attack

	Also

		Accept risk 	do it anyway  
		Transfer risk	insure $$$$ 
		Avoid risk	do something different

```

Authentication

```
Identity Proofing 	sign up with ID eg for passport : verify
			your identity with documents

What you ...

Something you   know		USERNAME / PASSWORD / PIN

		are		BIOMETRIC EG FINGER, RETINA, VOICE

		have		CAC / Smart / ATM card

		do		((Think handwriting recognition : 
				similar with 'way you type'))

Some where you are 		GEOLOCATION BY IP

Multifactor
		Common		SMARTCARD + PIN    (Dual)
				
				Exam : note : password + pin = 1
					factor (not 2)

OTP One Time PAD/Password	Text message : unique code valid
				one time

	TOTP	Time based: lasts 60 seconds

	HOTP	Hash based : message must match given hash

Password Policies

	LOCAL GPEDIT.MSC

	DOMAIN (GROUP POLICY)		

	Complex : 3 of 4 from   UPPER lower 1234   !@@@##$$%^%^

	Exam : find Group Policy:Computer:Windows:Security:Account

Lockout Policies	

	Lock account after x fails; lock for y minutes (0=forever)

		Reset partial count after z minutes

Default Passwords

	Often come with web devices eg wifi router : ensure
	you change them asap.

	Windows ==> CAN RENAME ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT 

		DISABLE GUEST ACCOUNT

```

Smart Cards

```
PIV Personal Identity Verification

Smart card is also called 'token based authentication'

```

Biometric login ERRORS!

```
False Acceptance Rate   FAR  ((Also called 'Type II' Error))

	Bad guy gets logged in  (should reject but doesn't)	

	

False Rejection

	Valid person : login rejected

```

AV Scan
False Positive	GOOD FILE : THINKS IS VIRUS

```
False Negative		BAD FILE  : NOT FLAGGED AS VIRUS	

```

Technologies to log you in to a computer system

```
Kerberos 

	Keeps Windows servers secure!!!  ((keeps Active Directory
		secure!!!)

	When you log in, Kerberos ISSUE YOU WITH A 'TOKEN'

	When you want access to a file you present this TOKEN

		Check : ACL : List of users ==> DO YOU HAVE 						PERMISSION ON THIS FILE?

				ACL = ACCESS CONTROL LIST
		
		      : ACE : fine permissions (ACCESS CONTROL ENTRY)

				FULL CONTROL	SET PERMISSIONS
				MODIFY		CHANGE/DELETE
				READ		VIEW ONLY
				EXECUTE
				WRITE		CREATE ONLY		
				LIST FOLDERS														

		Note : Clocks must be synchronised within 5 minutes!

	Kerberos : Port 88 !!!

LDAP
	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

		
	Active Directory is BUILT ON LDAP!!!

	Names look like

	CN(COMMON NAME)=Melinda Gates,OU=Managers, OU=Employees,
		DC=phil,DC=local

	OU = FOLDER (ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT)

	LDAP PORT = 389
	RDP  PORT = 3389

				((X.500 IS OLD))
	LDAP Secure : Encrypted

SSO Single Sign On

	Log in once, access to multiple sites

	
Companies Trusting Each Other

	Trust : One company trusts another 

	Transitive Trust

		A ==> B  and B ==> C

		then

		A  ==         ==>  C

ADFS Federation Services

	Permits SINGLE SIGN ON BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES

			 ((use certificates))
		==============>ADFS============>
	COMPANY A				COMPANY B
	
	USER A					((userA appears
						as read-only user))

		

SAML : language which enables SINGLE SIGN ON (XML LANGUAGE)

```

VPN Authentication (remote dial in)

```
PAP		Plain text : don't use!

CHAP		Don't use!

MS-CHAP2	Just OK! Minimum.	

EAP-TLS		Most secure : EAP (Shell) with TLS (Encryption)

		Secure : Certificates ON BOTH SERVER AND CLIENT

PEAP		Protected EAP
		
		Certificate on SERVER; Password on Client

```

RADIUS

```
Client ==> dial in 					ACTIVE
	   RAS dial-in  <---------RADIUS SERVER ------->
	   server		  validate login        DIRECTORY

RADIUS		BASIC
DIAMETER	BETTER  
TACACS+		BEST    (encrypt session)

```

	QUALITATIVE	MEDIUM CHANCE OF ATTACK : VAGUE, HARD TO 
			DEFINE.

			SUBJECTIVE : OPINION!

	
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT  : PASSIVE

	Scan of OWN SYSTEMS to determine where your weaknesses lie
			
		eg Night time check : are all doors locked!!!

		eg User accounts : check privileges!!
			(Privilege audit)

		eg Firewall : OPEN PORTS	

		eg Server : CHECK PATCH LEVELS

		eg Codes (door) : changed???

	*** EXAM ==> PASSIVE (NOT TAKING ACTION, NOT INTRUSIVE!)

To Talk To The Internet We Need :

```
1. IP		
2. MASK
3. GATEWAY
4. DNS

IP => ADDRESS OF PC			192.168.10.20

MASK ==> WHICH NETWORK WE ARE ON	
				255.    255.     255.     0
				1111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
				CIDR /24 = NUMBER OF 1'S IN MASK
					NETWORK IS 192.168.10.0

GATEWAY ==> TO INTERNET

DNS : MAP NAME TO IP	

```

SUBNET MASK IS A CHOICE THAT HUMANS MAKE TO DETERMINE SIZE OF YOUR NETWORK

```
CLASS C MASK /24	LIMITATION : 2 POWER 8 = 256 COMPUTERS MAX!

```

Types Of Firewall

```
Layer 3
	BLOCK BY IP ONLY!
	"STATELESS" FIREWALL  

Layer 4
	AWARE OF 'FLOW' OF TCP TRAFFIC (SEQUENCE 1,2,3,4...)
	"STATEFUL" FIREWAL

	WAF WEB APP FIREWALL		AROUND WEBSITE!

```

NAC NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL

```
Force clients to become COMPLIANT before they JOIN YOUR NETWORK

CHECK   1) Updates
	2) AV
	3) Firewall ON

FAIL ==> PUT PC TO QUARANTINE : FORCE PC TO 'HEAL' & GET UPDATES

```

NAT AND PAT

```
NAT can allow computers with PRIVATE IP to reach PUBLIC INTERNET

Swap our PRIVATE IP for the PUBLIC IP of our ROUTER

	(( add in a high port number so can get a reply eg 58885 ))

NAT = PAT  Network / Port address translation

	PAT = MANY PORTS
	NAT = ONE PORT  ( LOOSELY CALLED PAT/NAT ANYWAY)

```

Chapter 4

```
IDS	Intrusion DETECTION

	HIDS  on one computer (HOST) only 
	NIDS  on firewall : PROTECT WHOLE NETWORK

	Passive : ALERTS ONLY!  (help! we are under attack!!!)
	
IPS	Intrusion PREVENTION

	HIPS/NIPS

	Active : take action eg block firewall

Wireshark = Packet Sniffer = NETWORK PROTOCOL ANALYSER!!!!

```

Ways to DETECT AN ATTACK

```
1. Signature Based

	EVERY BAD VIRUS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT : TAKE IT'S HASH!!!

	SCAN OUR COMPUTER ETC FOR ALL GOOD FILES : IF ANY MATCH
	HASH OF A VIRUS ==> WE ALERT!!!!

2. Anomaly Based 

	'Baseline' graph of GOOD BEHAVIOUR EG CPU, RAM, NETWORK

	==> VIRUS : OFTEN SHOW AS INCREASED CPU ETC : Trigger
					an alert

		==> ANOMALY CHECKS AGAINST A GOOD BASELINE GRAPH!!

3. Behaviour Based  ** NOT SO RELIABLE (FALSE POSITIVES!!)

	Creates RULES : if a virus triggers a rule we get an 
			alert eg a certain process running on 
			our PC

	HEURISTIC = REAL TIME SCANNING   (SLOW PC!)

```

Detecting attacks

					scratch.  VMs, network etc

PRIVATE CLOUD		YOU ALONE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MACHINE
			IN THE DATACENTER 

PUBLIC CLOUD		SHARE ACCESS WITH MANY OTHERS EG PUBLIC 
			GODADDY

COMMUNITY CLOUD		SEVERAL COMPANIES WORK TOGETHER TO BUY
			THEIR OWN PRIVATE CLOUD, TOGETHER

```

Certificates

```
PKI 	Public Key Infrastructure : COMPANY WHICH USES CERTIFICATES

Private : VALID FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY 

		--   ONE COMPUTER
		--   MY WHOLE (INTERNAL) COMPANY (VALID INSIDE 
			COMPANY BUT NOT OUTSIDE)

			(( This certificate is not trusted ...))

Public  :   have to get issued by a formally recognised body
		eg 'VERISIGN' which will 'vet' you a bit like
		when you apply for a new passport

CA = Certificate Authority = ROOT (FIRST) SERVER IN YOUR COMPANY

	Intermediate server		LARGE COMPANIES

	Issuing server		work of issuing certificates

Certificates EXIST FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES

	eg SmartCard User, Domain Controller (computer),
		Exchange User ....

	Templates : for different purposes : customise

		YOU ASK FOR A CERTIFICATE		

	One way to VALIDATE WHO YOU ARE IS : SIGN YOUR OWN REQUESTS
		BEFORE SENDING OFF 

		CSR Certificate Signing Request : SIGN WITH YOUR OWN
			PRIVATE KEY then send off for approval

Revoke = Annul

	Two lists of 'revoked' certificates

Session Hijack

```
Client---------------Bad Router----------------Server

	Bad router can actually 'take over' session

		     Bad Router----------------Server

	Server THINKS STILL TALKING TO CLIENT BUT IS NOT: 
		BAD ROUTER IS IMPERSONATING AND HAS TAKEN
		OVER THE SESSION

```

Session Replay Attack

```
Valid session is copied and played back later

Client---------------Bad Router---------------Server

	later on Bad Router 'replay' same packets back to server
	to create a 'dummy' connection.

Mitigate using TIMESTAMPS

```

Password attack
Brute force	0000 through 9999 every combination in turn
STOP : using Account Lockout Policy
Dictionary attack	using obvious dictionary words

Birthday attack
TWO FILES CAN HAVE SAME HASH : USE THIS TO GET PAST OUR 'HASHING'	PROOF THAT A FILE HAS NOT CHANGED

Rainbow Table
Bad guys collect tables of hashes
Password	Hash
MyPass23	1234324hj5g324hj5g324g

SERVICES
2) DATABASE SERVER
3) EXCHANGE EMAIL ETC

Injection Attacks

```
Website : FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION
	  eg
		name..........  dob........  
		address.........

				SUBMIT

It's possible to INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING TEXT, SUBMIT CODE INSTEAD!!!
	
SQL
	REGULAR SQL : SELECT * FROM USERS ...

	FORM : Instead of submitting name, submit SQL code instead.
	
LDAP	
XML

```

Input Validation

```
Check for 'strange' characters like \\ / < > ' "   etc in fields

```

Buffer Overflow Attack

```
Buffer 
	Temporary data store to hold information when network
	is slow : waiting for data to either send or receive

	Buffer data is stored in RAM of COMPUTER!

	Buffer Overflow attack ==> PUSH GOOD DATA OUT OF BUFFER,
		POSSIBLY GET ACCESS TO AREAS OF RAM NEXT TO 
		THE BUFFER WHICH NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

```

XSS Cross Site Scripting

```
Hack in to one website and from there, hack into another	

```

Folder Traversal Attack

```
Reach one folder : from there, navigate and reach another folder

Failure and Recovery

```
MTBF		Mean Time Between Failures

		Light bulb : last 100,000 hours
		MTBF = 100,000 HOURS !!! RELIABLE!!!
		BIGGER VALUE IS BETTER
		((USE WITH HARD DRIVE))
			
			MTTF mean time TO FAIL  (once)

MTTR

		Mean Time To Repair

		Hard drive fails : RAID ==> fix immediately!

			replace drive .. done!!!  (RAID1, RAID5)

				: NO RAID!!!  BUILD SERVER FROM
					SCRATCH + RESTORE BACKUP
					+ RE-TEST ETC

				2 TO 3 DAYS!!!

```

Enemy techniques for scanning

```
Footprinting		LEGAL MEANS TO GET DATA ON PEOPLE AND 				COMPANIES.  WE ALL LEAVE A 'FOOTPRINT' ONLINE
			EG SOCIAL MEDIA, WEBSITES ETC

Fingerprinting		NON-LEGAL MEANS TO GET INFO EG HOSTS/NETWORK
			IPS OF COMPUTERS IN A COMPANY.  Scan network
			illegally to find out servers, printers,
			users etc  ==> getting ready to attack

Banner Grabbing		Sending requests to websites etc : OBSERVE
			HEADER INFORMATION COMING BACK ==> find 
			out eg server running Apache + version

			curl  ==> same as http:// 

APT Advanced Persistent Threat

	Persistent malware can be installed on a remote system
	and cause trouble over months or even years ==> Advanced
	Persistent Threat

Credentialed Scan ==> you are logged in when performing a scan

Layer 2

```
LAN LAYER

PC AND SWITCHES COMMUNICATE

How???
    Address of each machine ==> MAC ADDRESS

        IPCONFIG /ALL ==> 'Physical address'
                       (Hardware)

    Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 60-67-20-78-0B-C6

What 'protocol' do we use to send data?

    Ethernet!!!

    Ethernet 'frame' is packet of data

| destination mac | source mac | data | CRC Error check |

    
Switch will be the central point of our network
    
    Analyse all packets
    Build table
    PORT     MAC
    1    ...
    2    ...
    3    ...

    Switch create 'virtual circuit' between computers
        so transfer is very quick eg 1Gbps

        Class E : research

```

Layer 3 : Routing

```
Second purpose of LAYER 3 is to CREATE EFFICIENT ROUTES 
        ACROSS THE INTERNET

    = 'ROUTING'

RIP = Routing Internet Protocol

    Basic : Router share ALL OF ITS KNOWN INFORMATION
            EVERY 30 SECONDS!  (BROADCAST TO ALL)

EIGRP ==> CISCO upgrade to RIP

    Same but ONLY SEND DATA IF A CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE; 
        OTHERWISE SILENT!!

RIP and EIGRP

    Distance around world measured in

        HOPS  (Call this a 'metric' which we can measure)

```

Layer 4 : Transport layer

```
So far
    1    Physical 
    2    Ethernet, Switch, MAC
    3    IP : Private and Public

        IP Packet :  Source IP, Destination IP, Data
            

        Routing : RIP and EIGRP

What is lacking in layer 3???

    We don't know if our data has arrived!

TCP    checking BUT SLOW!!!  (Better slow data than no data!!!)

    Two fields
    1. Sequence SEQ
    2. Acknowledge ACK

    SEQ : COUNT SENT PACKETS 1,2,3,4,5
    ACK : RECEIVER SENDS BACK WHAT ARRIVED EG 1,2,4,5

    SENDER : MISSING ACK ON PACKET 3 SO RESEND

    3-way handshake 
        Client : Hey, are you ready to receive?
        Server : yes
        Client : OK let's begin         
        

UDP    Streaming radio ==> use UDP - NO CHECKING!!!

    
TCP     SLOW, CHECKING        Connection-Oriented
UDP     FAST, NO CHECKING     Connectionless

Firewall
    IP            StateLESS
    TCP            StateFUL
    UDP            StateLESS

```

Layer 5

```
Create, manage, terminate 'session'

    Session = flow of data eg skype, Youtube, Messenger, email

```

Layer 6 : Presentation

```
Compress
    Large .WAV   ==> small .MP3
          .WMV             .MP4
          .RAW             .jpg

Encrypt    

```

Layer 7 Application

```
eg Skype, Outlook ==> request access to network

```

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
Dial up ==> PPP create connection (layer 2)

Encrypt 'tunnel' across INTERNET  

    LAN - LAN            Permanent, Tunnel Mode

    Home (laptop) ==> dial in to - LAN    Temp, Transport Mode

4 encryption methods

    PPTP    1723        Old, Point-to-point
    
    L2TP    1701        Good, strong, certificates
                IPSEC (built-in IP encryption)
    
    SSTP    443        VPN OVER HTTPS = SSL / TLS

                VPN over WEB!!!

    IKEV2    500, 4500    Latest, strong, certificates
                IPSEC (built-in IP encryption)

                VPN Reconnect : if on wifi/4g 
                and it 'drops' out, then can 
                reconnect without authentication

Encryption

```
Cryptography = Science Of Encryption

Plain text                        Cipher Text
                            (encrypted)

        Algorithm    Key(user)   Key (system)
                        'salt'

        FIXED        Unique        Second password
                        Random, unique

        WEP2 with       WIFI KEY        
        AES encryption

```

3 types of encryption

```
Symmetric
Asymmetric
Hashing

```

Symmetric

```
FAST!
ONE KEY (think WIFI!)
also "Shared key"
also "reversible"

AES    (exam, good answer)
older    DES, 3DES, RC4, Blowfish, Twofish

Summary : one key both ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT. Fast. AES.

    <<older WPA also symmetric : Used TKIP encryption>>

Session key = Symmetric key lasting 10 minutes (eg web 'session')

```

Asymmetric = PKI Public Key Encryption

```
2 Keys

    PRIVATE & PUBLIC KEY

Slow 

Super strong !!!  (Certificates can last 30 years!!!))

    Either key can ENCRYPT : Other must decrypt!

Encryption Example

    Bob send Paul some encrypted data

    1)  Paul send to Bob his PUBLIC KEY (anyone can have
                your public key)

    2) Bob use Paul's PUBLIC KEY TO ENCRYPT THE DATA

    3) Send encrypted file to Paul

    4) Paul : read with PAUL'S PRIVATE KEY

        done!!!

Verifying Sender's Identity

    Goal : ensure email sender is GENUINE

    Commander : send bulk email

    1) Encrypt email with PRIVATE KEY of commander
    2) Send email
    3) Troops : UNLOCK WITH PUBLIC KEY of commander 
        ==> know it's genuine

PKI : Asymmetric : SUPER STRONG BUT SUPER SLOW!!!  2 keys public/
        private

```

Hashing

```
Integrity : ENSURE DATA HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL

MD5
SHA1

((SHA256/512 are government approved))

Hashing : summary : checks if file has changed (Integrity)

Using hashing today

    Passwords
        mysecretpassword        

            Stored ==>             

```

08cd923367890009657eab812753379bdb321eeb

```
    Hashing ==> also called 'ONE WAY ENCRYPTION'

        ((proven cannot reverse this))

    Bad guys ==> COLLECT 'RAINBOW TABLES' OF UP TO 50GB OR
        MORE OF PASSWORDS AND THEIR HASH

```

Signature

```
Goal of 'signing' a document is two fold

    1) Prove who created it  "Publisher"

    2) Prove file has not changed (integrity)

1. Take your file

2. Hash your file

3. With your PRIVATE KEY, ENCRYPT JUST THE 'HASH'!

    SIGNATURE OF FILE = ENCRYPTED HASH OF FILE !!!

At run time we must VERIFY THE SIGNATURE

    
1. Use PUBLIC KEY OF PUBLISHER (CREATOR OF FILE) to 
    DECRYPT THE HASH

2. Re-hash original file and compare this hash with the
    decrypted hash : should match

    MYFILE.DOC   ==>   HASH   =>    ENCRYPTED HASH

    CHECK
    
    1.         HASH    <<<==    ENCRYPTED HASH

    2. MYFILE.DOC ==> HASH    

```

Darill Gibson Book

Chapter 1

C Confidentiality = Encryption

I Integrity = Data has not changed

A Availability = Data can be used

A Authentication = LOG IN

A Authorisation = GRANTED ACCESS / PERMISSION TO A FILE

A Accounting = LOGGING WHO DID WHAT, WHEN

Authentication

```
Credentials

    Log in User/Password

```


Use of the 'MAC' word

```
1. MAC address
2. MAC Mandatory Access Control (Clearance)  CLASSIFY FILE
            WITH 'TOP SECRET'
3. (H) MAC  Hash a message   Hash based message : verify message
            intact

```

PKI use of Certificates

```
CERTIFICATE is a digital container to hold you 'key'

    PUBLIC CERTIFICATES ONLINE EG VERISIGN

SIGNATURE ==> VALIDATE A FILE THAT IT'S GENUNINE

    HASH ==> VERIFY FILE HAS NOT CHANGED

    SIGNATURE ==> VERIFIES 1) FILE HAS NOT CHANGED (HASH)
                   2) ID OF SENDER/PUBLISHER/OWNER
                    (PUBLIC/PRIVATE PAIR)

        = NON-REPUDIATION which means we can't deny
            that something happened.

           EG DATABASE FILE : SIGNED : PROVE IN COURT 
            OF LAW IT WASN'T TAMPERED WITH.

```

Availability

```
Is data available?

Redundancy : If a system fails, we have procedures in place
        to fix this quickly

Fault tolerance : can cope with a failure and still keep operating

RAID 

    RAID 0        Striping    No redundancy but FAST!!
            2 drives    Use in WEB SERVER / 
                    DATABASE SERVER

    RAID 1        Mirror         2 drives; copy of each

clustering

    front end servers

    SERVERA        A FAILS, B TAKES OVER  ('FAIL OVER')
    SERVERB

Load balancing

    CLIENT ==> LOAD BALANCER  ==>   SERVER FARM    A/B/C/D/E

        round robin requests to A/B/C/D/E in turn

Site redundancy (hot/warm/cold site)

    Hot site : full power + computers ready to go ** EXPENSIVE

    Warm site : building + devices off 

    Cold site : building only : bare building + electrical 
                    power

Backup

UPS    Uninterruptible Power supply : battery lasting 30 minutes

Single Point Of Failure : one critical component that, if
    fails, we have no service

HVAC system : 

    Heating, Ventilation, Air Con

Patching 
    keeping system up to date

Fail safe        Power saw, two hands to power on

Fail open        Door : power out ==> door swing open
            
Fail secure/shut    Door : power out ==> door remain locked

                INSIDE : MANUAL OVERRIDE TO ESCAPE

```

Defense In Depth

```
layered defences

```

Risk

```
Vulnerability    weakness in our system

    Misconfiguring server
    Lack of patching (updates)
    Firewall OPEN PORTS
    Permissions (access control) not monitored
    Back door : HACK CREATED BY PROGRAMMER TO LOG IN 
        BYPASS ALL SECURITY        
    Lack of fire suppression
    Lack of PHYSICAL SECURITY EG GUARD, BARRIER ETC
    
Threat : something malicious which wants to attack

    Insider threat (malicious employee)
    Malware
    Virus
    Worm
    

Risk is Chance that a THREAT will EXPLOIT (USE) A VULNERABILITY
        TO ATTACK YOU

What to do with Risk!!!

    Mitigate ==> REDUCE RISK (wear HIGH VIS VEST)

    Accept risk : do it anyway!

    Transfer risk : pay insurer

    Avoid risk : do something completely different

Impact = HOW MUCH DAMAGE WILL BE CAUSED!!!

    Issue : Virus hits system

    SLE    Single Loss Expectancy        $10,000

    ARO    Annual Rate Of Occurrence    2

    ALE    Annual Loss Expectancy

        ALE = SLE X ARO  = 10000 X 2  = $20,000

```

Identity & Authentication

```
Something you ...

    know        User/password/PIN

    are        Biometric eg fingerprint, retina scan

    have        CAC Card  (Token based authentication)

    do        way you type!!!

Some WHERE YOU ARE    geolocation of IP

    

Password policy

    Complex password ==> UPPER + lower + 1234 + !@#$

        Windows ==> 3 out 4 acceptable (not all 4)

        (view in Group Policy / GPEDIT.MSC which is
            managing ONE COMPUTER)
            

Lockout policy

    Fail to log in ==> lock your account after x fails

        Duration of lockout : 0 minutes ==> for ever!
                (admin has to unlock)

Default Passwords

    !!! care !!! Many internet devices COME WITH BUILT-IN
    DEFAULT USER AND PASSWORD WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON THE 

```

INTERNET

```
        Care ! Change quickly !

```

Smart cards (something you have)

```
Chip : contain certificate

    ((Token based authentication : granted TOKEN when you
        log in))

CAC

PIV card

```

Multifactor

```
Smartcard (token)      1 factor    (you have)
PIN            1 factor    (you know)

```

One Time Password

```
OTP    one time password (eg text to your phone)

TOTP    time based : expire after 2 minutes

HOTP    hash based : can only use one time 
    
        file    +   1        
        file    +   2  

```

Biometric

```
False positive        flags eg as VIRUS but it's a good file

False negative        Virus which gets through

Login
    False Acceptance : Type 2 error : let unauthorised through
        FAR False Acceptance Rate

    False Rejection : Valid person rejected

```

Authentication Services

```
Kerberos
    
    Active Directory is SECURED WITH KERBEROS

    Log in : get a TOKEN.

        Use this token when want access to a file : 
        present token.

        ACL Access Control List ==> check

            1) ARE YOU ON THE LIST?

            2) ACE ENTRY : DO YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL/
                MODIFY/READ/WRITE ETC ???

    ((All computers must be within 5 minutes of each other))

LDAP
    
    LDAPS = Secure version

SSO Single Sign On

    Forest ==> GROUP OF DOMAINS  EG Microsoft.com bought
            msn.com, skype.com, hotmail.com

    Trust ==> BETWEEN DOMAINS

        Transitive == 'THROUGH' TRUST

            A==>B  B==>C  so now A==>B==>C     

    Federation = GROUP OF COMPANIES WHICH TRUST EACH OTHER

        COMPANYA:USER:JOE  ==> LOG IN AND GAIN ACCESS 
            TO COMPANYB

            (VIEW USER:JOE AS read only user in
                CompanyB)

    SAML ==> XML language to enable SSO between companies

Ways to Authenticate REMOTELY INTO YOUR SYSTEM

```
RAS = Remote Access Service = dialing remotely into your system

    RAS can involve
        1) Dialing to a phone number
        2) Dialing to an IP Address

    On top then can create a VPN with encryption

Client ==> RAS Server ==>  RADIUS server  ==> Active Directory  
               (authenticate 
                  with Active
               Directory)

      RAS1
      RAS2
      RAS3  (many RAS   (only 1 RADIUS
         servers)     server)

```

Authentication Types

```
PAP    Plain Text : DO NOT USE!!!

Chap    Not quite as bad as PAP but still - avoid using

MS-Chap2 : Microsoft : OK to use (passwords)

EAP-TLS  : uses CERTIFICATES ON CLIENT and SERVER (both machines)

PEAP     : Protected EAP : Good as CERTIFICATE ON SERVER;
        password for user on client

LEAP : Lightweight EAP : Cisco : DO NOT USE!  (Vulnerabilities)

```

Advanced Authentication Types for VPN

```
RADIUS

    CLIENT==>RAS DIAL-IN SERVER==>  RADIUS ==>  AD BACK END    

    Job of RADIUS is to verify user credentials with 
        Active Directory

DIAMETER

    Improved version of RADIUS (pun : DIAMETER is twice length
                    of RADIUS of a circle...!)

TACACS+    : best of these 3 (better than RADIUS or DIAMETER)

    full encryption of authentication traffic

Types of control to STOP INCIDENTS!!!

```
Technical Control
    Using technology eg 

        Firewall : block IP traffic

        IDS Intrusion Detection  : Alert eg email

            NIDS Network Intrusion (for whole network)
            HIDS Host based intrusion (for one server)    

        IPS Intrusion Prevention : Take action eg
            Temporarily stop traffic getting into 
            network

            NIPS    : whole network 
            HIPS    : one HOST (SERVER)

        Encryption

        Antivirus

        Motion detection camera

Management Control

    Create POLICIES 

        AUP Acceptable Use
        Password policy
        Lockout policy
        Disaster recovery policy
        Data protection policy
        ...

    Auditing : CHECK IF POLICIES BEING USED!!!

        Policy Enforcement : ensure people DOING WHAT
            POLICY ASKS

    Risk : 
        1) Risk Assessment
        2) Monetarise (calculate how much money to 
                spend on reducing risk)
        3) Mitigate : take action : reduce risk

    Vulnerability Assessment

        Pay 'Ethical Hacker' (White Hat Hacker) to 
        scan your systems for weaknesses
            
            FIREWALL
                OPEN PORTS
                ACL : ACCESS RULES / LISTS
            PHYSICAL : DOORS, CAMERAS, ETC...
            SOFTWARE : HACKABLE
            RUNNING SERVICES : UNNECESSARY (TURN OFF)

    Penetration Testing

        Pay 'Ethical Hacker' to ACTUALLY TRY AND HACK
        IN TO YOUR SYSTEM

            ==> Hacker, if break in, would prove 
            the 'exploit to a point 

        ACTUALLY BREAK IN TO YOUR SYSTEM

Operational Control

    Day-to-day implementation of policies etc advised
        by management

    Clean desk policy : no passwords or data visible overnight

    Change Management

        Authorised, approved changes

        1. Cost analysis
        2. Risk analysis => can anything go wrong?
        3. Backup??? ==> Roll back if necessary
        4. Approval and sign off
        
    Configuration Management

        Ensuring if our machine fails eg server, router,
        switch ==> we have good mechanism for restoring
        all correct settings (configuration)

        Mistake ==> restore to correct also

Sending data

    To send data we need

    1) IP Address

    2) Port which is a channel to reach this IP

        ((Think IP = fortified castle, port = approved
            channel into that castle))

Router / Firewall

```
In this course we have 2 ACL

1) Windows - each folder has an ACL with users and permissions

2) Firewall - each firewall will have an ACCESS CONTROL LIST

    TO ALLOW OR DENY IP TRAFFIC

Firewalls BLOCK TRAFFIC BY

    1)    IP

    2)    PORT

    3)    PROGRAM eg Skype

    4)    PROTOCOL EITHER TCP / UDP

            ui.linksys.com   100 routers to log into!

Implicit Deny

    a door is LOCKED BY DEFAULT!

    Users are LOCKED OUT BY ASSUMPTION (IMPLICIT DENY)
    unless granted EXPLICIT ACCESS

Host-based firewall : on ONE PC EG WINDOWS FIREWALL

Network based : ON GATEWAY DEVICE :PROTECTS WHOLE LAN

Firewall rule looks like

    PERMIT/DENY    SOURCE     DESTINATION  PORT     PROTOCOL

```

tcp/udp/ip=both

```
    DENY        ANY    ANY         ALL     IP
           (LAST RULE = DENY ALL = IMPLICIT DENY)    

DMZ

    A DMZ (DE-MILITARIZED ZONE) IS A TERM FOR AN AREA BETWEEN
        2 ARMIES.

    In networking, a DMZ is an area OUTSIDE OUR LAN
        to host a PUBLIC FACING WEB SERVER

    DMZ = PERIMITER NETWORK = SCREENED SUBNET

        Even if hacker hacks in, limited damage is done

DMZ can host a 'Web site' or a 'Web Application' (much 
        the same thing)

    WAF = Web Application Firewall : protect our web app!

```

Firewall types

```
Layer 3        simple firewall : block by IP

        "stateless" firewall : INSPECTS EACH PACKET
            INDIVIDUALLY : unware of 'STATE' OR 'FLOW'
            OF PACKETS

Layer 4        "stateful" firewall : AWARE OF FLOW OF TRAFFIC
            (TCP : sequence count so can track
            a flow of packets)

Layer 7        Application layer firewall : DEEP PACKET INSPECTION
        where INSPECT CONTENTS OF PACKETS for malware!
        (even inside ZIP files)

            can be slow!!! as quite intrusive!!!

```

Ways of splitting up your network

```
1. Router     by IP

2. VLAN        by MAC address on a SWITCH

3. Firewall     block IP traffic

```

NAT and PAT

```
Network Address Translation

Port Address Translation

On our LAN we have a PRIVATE IP EG 192.168.12.10

This is BANNED FROM THE INTERNET!!!

At our ROUTER we turn on NAT Network Address Translation

    we 1) STRIP OUT PRIVATE IP 
       2) REPLACE WITH PUBLIC IP   (FIND OUT WITH 'WHATISMYIP')

IP PACKET BEFORE

        source ip    destination ip        data
        192.168.12.10    157.240.20.35        ....
    
IP PACKET AFTER

        source ip    destination ip     port    data
        80.187.110.1    157.240.20.35    54348    ...

NAT : officially just copes 1 private to 1 public IP

PAT : can cope with 10,000 private computers for 1 public IP

    BUT!!! normally NAT and PAT mean same thing ie 
        many computers ==> all swap IP at router

```

Proxy Server

```
To monitor internet usage we can install a proxy on our network

Proxy allows us to

1) Know which users are using the internet
2) Know which sites
3) Check BLACKLISTED SITES
4) Check Virus in Downloads
5) Cache (store) content for other users  (busy sites, next user
    get content from cache so quicker)

URL FILTER : CHECK URL FOR BLACKLISTED SITES

```

UTM Unified Threat Management

```
Umbrella term : ALL SECURITY DEVICES!!!

```

Web Security Gateway

```
Content Filtering : checking web pages for MALICIOUS CONTENT

```

How to detect an attack!!!

```
How does ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE WORK???

    It takes HASHES OF KNOWN VIRUSES AND DOWNLOADS THE 
    HASHES TO YOUR COMPUTER.  

    SCAN YOUR COMPUTER ==> ANY FILES WHICH MATCH THE 
        VIRUS HASHES ARE FLAGGED

SIGNATURE BASED SCANNING 

    CHECK AGAINST HASHES (SIGNATURE) OF KNOWN VIRUSES

ANOMALY BASED SCANNING

    Take a BASELINE OF PREDICTED BEHAVIOUR

        Watch for deviations from predicted behaviour

        ((Heuristic = Real time scanning))

BEHAVIOUR BASED

    MATCH TRAFFIC AGAINST FIXED RULES OR PATTERNS

        (CAN BE PRONE TO 'FALSE POSITIVE')

Overview so far

Wireshark = packet sniffing = Network Protocol Analyser
IDS = Intrusion Detection : Passive (alert only)
IPS = Intrusion Prevention : Active : can take action = eg move machine
to another subnet
HIPS = host based = ONE MACHINE
NIPS = network based = ROUTER/GATEWAY/FIREWALL : PROTECT WHOLE NETWORK

Types of floods we can defend against
TCP : SYN FLOOD : abusing '3-way handshake' to force
server to reserve space for non-existent
connections
PING FLOOD
SMURF ATTACK : MALFORMED PINGS

```
FLOODS IN GENERAL

    DOS ATTACK DENIAL OF SERVICE
    DDOS DISTRIBUTED DOS ATTACK : FROM MANY COMPUTERS
    BOTNET : NETWORK OF INFECTED COMPUTERS WORKING
        TOGETHER TO ATTACK YOU
    ZOMBIE COMPUTER : HAS BEEN INFECTED BUT YOU MAY NOT NOTICE
        (INFECTION MIGHT BE DORMANT)
    LOGIC BOMB : TRIGGER TO WAKE UP ZOMBIE COMPUTER TO ATTACK
                    YOU

```

Ways to dectect viruses or attacks

```
SIGNATURE BASED

    EVERY VIRUS HAS A 'HASH' 
    SYMANTEC ANTIVIRUS COLLECT ALL 'HASHES' FROM KNOWN
        VIRUSES.  DOWNLOAD TO YOUR PC 
        VIRUS SCAN : CHECK COMPUTER : MATCH ANY HASHES

ANOMALY : CREATE GRAPH 'BASELINE' : CHECK FOR DEVIATIONS

BEHAVIOUR : CREATE 'RULES'  : ALERT IF RULES ARE BROKEN/TRIGGERED

    Final release : code is now ready!!!

Unit        Small piece of code

Integration    Join code together : test together

System        System as a whole

Regression    Fix a bug ==> re-test software to check 
            you haven't broken something else

```
Get nothing : build VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE FROM SCRATCH!!!

    GET NOTHING : MUST BUILD EVERYTHING

```

MAAS Management ...

```
Outsource admin tasks like checking logs, compliance etc

```

PRIVATE CLOUD

```
You buy your OWN SERVER!!! NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS! MORE SECURE!

```

PUBLIC CLOUD

```
Website hosted ==> CARE!! as files are on a server which
    is shared with many others ==> so hacking risk is
    higher!!!

```

COMMUNITY CLOUD

```
2 OR 3 COMPANIES TOGETHER BUY THEIR OWN PRIVATE CLOUD AND
    SHARE IT

```

Chapter 6 : Malware

Malware - any malicious software of any description (catch-all term)

Virus - needs a 'host' program in order to function. eg Word 'macro'
virus only runs if Word runs

Worm - can 'self-exist' and 'self-replicate'

Trojan - innocent-looking file with malware inside eg music file

Polymorphic Virus - change itself so that the 'hash' changes

Armored Virus - avoid detection by giving false info eg incorrect
readings about its location inside RAM

Zombie = virus doing nothing right now

Logic Bomb = trigger to make a Zombie start working

Botnet = group of infected computers

```
Bot => ONE ROBOT!

```

DOS attack = flood your server to stop it working

```
DOS = denial of service

DDOS = distributed - attack from many computers

```

Backdoor ==> created by programmer to quickly log in and bypass security

```
    ** not done any more!!! ***

```

Rootkit ==> affect PC eg ON HARD DRIVE, MOTHERBOARD, BIOS (BOOT SETTINGS)
==> BEFORE EVEN INSTALL WINDOWS!!!!

```
    very hard for WINDOWS TO EVEN DETECT IT!!!

    ((Offline scan : shut Windows down and scan from DVD))

```

Cookie

```
TEXT FILE IN BROWSER WITH CODED DATA TO TRACK YOUR BROWSING

```

Spyware

```
cookie to track eg shopping habits : STATISTICS IS BIG MONEY!!!
    AGE, OCCUPATION, TIME OF DAY, GENDER, INTERESTS ETC

```

Adware

```
pushing adverts 

```

Social Engineering = a HUMAN PERSON BEING TRICKED!!!

Shoulder Surf : watch people typing!!!

Dumpster Diving : looking through trash for info

Spam BOGUS EMAIL

Spim!!! BOGUS MESSAGE OVER IM

Phishing : bogus links/sites

Vishing : attack over (VOIP) phone

Spear Phishing : targeting INDIVIDUAL

Whaling : targeting HIGH VALUE INDIVIDUALS EG CEO

Privilege Escalation ==> more permissions than you ought

AntiVirus

```
Signature Based        MATCH AGAINST FIXED HASH

Anomaly            DEVIATE FROM BASELINE GRAPH

    Heuristic        REAL TIME SCANNING

```

Zero Day = FIND VIRUS IN NEWLY RELEASED SOFTWARE

Chapter 7

PING FLOOD : lots of PINGS

```
Smurf attack  = malformed PING (fake the sender IP)

```

TCP SYN FLOOD

```
Send lots of 'TCP hello' requests

```

PORT SCAN

```
Scan your network for open ports

    MXTOOLBOX 

```

XMAS ATTACK

```
Scan network : flags set to '1' or 'high' to provoke a response
    to get extra info back

BANNER GRABBING : SEND MESSAGE TO WEBSITE OR SERVER : HOPE TO 
    GET RESPONSE WHICH GIVES US BASIC INFO LIKE SERVER
    TYPE OR OPERATING SYSTEM

```

MITM Man in the middle attack

```
Client--------- bad router -----------    Server

        bad router listens or
        'eavesdrops' on messages.
        Also can alter packets

```

Session Hijack

```
client         bad router -------------server

        Server thinks it's talking to client
        but it's not.  bad router has 'hijacked'
        the session

```

Session Replay Attack

```
Bad router will copy all packets.  Later on, resend.

    EASY TO STOP : USE TIMESTAMPS!!!

```

Birthday attack

```
DISCOVER THAT TWO FILES HAVE SAME HASH AND CAN EXPLOIT THIS
    TO GET PASS HASHING SOFTWARE

```

DNS attack

```
DNS POISON
    
    fake DNS records eg SERVERA  IP = 1.2.3.4

        people looking for SERVERA get sent to wrong IP

PHARMING ATTACK

    Sending client to WRONG SITE : OFTEN HACK INTO LOCAL 
    COMPUTER (HOSTS FILE : CAN CHANGE THIS)

    c:windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc

```

Chapter 7 continued

Typo Squatting

```
Buying domains with A) MIS-SPELLING or B) ADDING EXTRA WORDS
    to well known domains

gooogle.com

```

URL Hijacking

```
Buying domain names that don't belong to you --> make money
    from selling to legitimate owner

```

Watering hole attack

```
Social media and other popular websites ==> place where
    'opportunist' hackers can hang out, looking for
    people/systems to attack

```

Flash Cookie and 'LSO' locally shared objects

```
==> old!!!  Cookies on Flash Websites!!!

```

Application Attacks

```
EXPLOIT VULNERABILITIES IN APPS/WEBSITES THAT YOU USE

Injection Attack

    Form........Name?   Address?? Zip Code???  Phone??

    ATTACKER PUTS PROGRAMMING CODE INSTEAD OF ANSWERS TO 
            QUESTION!!!

    
Input Validation

    CHECK ALL INPUT FOR ODD CHARACTERS LIKE

        ' \\  <  >  *  ETC

    check numbers/dates not too high/low

    block <script>  code (HTML)

    CLIENT = YOUR PHONE OR PC  ** EASILY HACKED **

    SERVER = DATA SENT TO SERVER

        MUST VALIDATE DATA AT BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER!

Race condition : two programs accessing SAME DATA AT SAME TIME

Error
    Bank loan ==> CALCULATE WRONG RATE!!!

Exception

    CRASH!!!  SYSTEM RUNNING : HITS BUG , STOP WORKING!!

        ==> GIVE DETAILED ERROR  ((HACKER CAN USE THIS
            TO GET INFO))

Buffer Overflow Attack

                    RAM
    Hard drive  ========>   ||||||||||||||||||  BUFFER  <====>|
                reserved RAM               OVERFLOW
    Network card

    Router

    Switch

        Buffer overflow ==> ATTEMPTING TO DELIBERATELY
            FORCE DATA INTO BUFFER.  GOAL : OVERFLOW
            LEGAL BOUNDARIES TO ACCESS OTHER AREAS
            OF RAM

Injection Attack

    SQL : database
    LDAP : Active Directory
    XML : 

Cross-site scripting

    Public website hosting : danger is attacker hack into
    one website ==> gain access to another.

XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery

    Logged in to website so potential for hacking is greater

Credentialed attack : logged in
Non-credentialled attack : not logged it

Directory Traversal ==> 

    c:\\MYSITE\\...

    hacker.. use this to gain access also to

    c:\\myothersite\\....  (different folder)

Fuzz Testing

    Test application ==> DOES IT STAND UP TO USER ABUSE???

        Try to send RANDOM DATA INTO APP TO SEE IF 
            IT CRASHES!!!  FUZZ TESTING !!!

```

Certificates

```
Certificates help us VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS

PUBLIC : ANYONE CAN HAVE

PRIVATE : KEEP SECURE

```

Installing a Certificate Server (CA = Certificate Authority)

```
SERVER ROLE !!!

ROOT CA

    INTERMEDIATE CA

        ISSUING CA ==> GIVE OUT CERTIFICATES TO USERS

Template : used to give DETAILS OF A CERTIFICATE WHEN IT'S 
        REQUESTED BY A USER

    - encryption type
    - how long is it valid (eg 5 years)
    - use eg Email Signing, Smartcard, Encryption ...

Enrol ==> Ask for a certificate eg user needs for encryption

    Auto-enrol : server handle
    Manual enrol : human must approve

    Already a user : want another certificate

        CSR CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST

            Sign a request with your private key,
            Send to server,
            Returned a FRESH CERTIFICATE

Revoke = Annul a certificate

    2 lists of revoked certificates

    1) OFFLINE  :    CRL  Certificate Revocation List (all
                    bad certificates)

        EXAM : PROBLEM : CAN GET BIG, SLOW TO USE!

        << delta CRL = most recent updates>>

    2) ONLINE  : OCSP online certificate status protocol

        QUICK : only check for 1 certificate

    ESCROW : STORE CERTIFICATES WITH 3RD PARTY COMPANY

        !!! CAREFUL !!!

        M OF N 

            UNLOCK CERTIFICATE : REQUIRE M PEOPLE
            FROM GROUP OF N PRESENT

            EG 2 OF 5

```

Risk (325)

```
Impact ==> how much we are affected by something bad happening
        
SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY == HOW MUCH 1 INCIDENT COSTS  

ARO ANNUAL RATE OCCURENCE == TIMES PER YEAR

ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY = SLE X ARO

    SLE = $10,000
    ARO = 10 / YEAR
    ALE = $100,000  / YEAR

Quantitative

    numerical analysis  30% chance

Qualitative

    Guestimate  :  medium risk ?????

MTBF    Mean Time Between Failure  ~~~~  MTTF

        Light Bulb MTBF = 100,000 YEARS

MTTR Mean Time to Repair / Recover / Restore

    SERVER GOES DOWN WITH HARD DRIVE

        1) NEW HARD DRIVE
        2) BACKUP RESTORE
        3) CONFIGURE ==========> 4 DAYS!!!

```

Steps the attacker uses

```
Footprinting        public knowledge - legal means to find
            out info about you

Fingerprinting         illegal methods to gain info about you
            eg ip scan, port scan, other attacks

Banner Grabbing        Send packets to server : analyse 
            HEADERS COMING BACK TO YOU (INITIAL 
            RESPONSE)

```

What we can do

```
Vulnerability Assessment

    ANALYSING YOUR COMPANY FOR FLAWS

    Vulnerability Scan ==> NICHE SCAN : ONE TYPE OF FLAW
        EG OPEN PORTS

        NON-INTRUSIVE !

Pen Test ==> Penetration Test : ACTUALLY TRY AND HACK IN!!!

    INTRUSIVE !!!

Code review : reading programming code : spot flaws

Audits : check for 

    COMPLIANCE TO POLICY
    LOGS : EVIDENCE OF BREAK IN ETC

```

Backups

```
Archive Bit = 1 or 0

    1 = NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP
    0 = DOESN'T NEED TO BE BACKED UP

Full = Normal = Back up everything

Incremental : Fresh backup every day of JUST WORK THAT HAS 
            CHANGED THAT DAY

                    ((reset archive 'bit'))

Differential : Fresh backup every day of ALL FILES CHANGED
            SINCE LAST FULL BACKUP (doesn't touch 
                        archive bit))

                CUMULATIVE DAILY BACKUP

Diffential Example

    Friday : Full Backup 50GB
    Monday : Differential 500MB
    Tues   : Mon(500MB) + Tues(300MB)

802.1X ==> CAN HAVE A DATABASE (ACCESS VIA RADIUS) TO VERIFY ACCESS
AUTHENTICATION SERVER
RADIUS
DIAMETER
TACACS+ BEST
ENCRYPTION TYPES
THREE MAIN TYPES OF ENCRYPTION
SYMMETRIC
ASYMMETRIC
HASHING
SYMMETRIC : ONE KEY : FAST : NOT SECURE
SESSION KEY : RENEW EVERY 10 MINUTES
AES BEST ***
DES
3DES
BLOWFISH
TWOFISH
RC4
ASYMMETRIC : 2 KEYS PUBLIC PRIVATE
ASYMMETRIC : SLOW BUT SECURE
CERTIFICATE : 'ENVELOPE' TO HOLD PUBLIC KEY
RSA
ECC : ELLIPTIC CURVE : PHONES
DH DIFFIE HELLMAN
DHE DIFFIE HELLMAN EPHEMERAL (TEMPORARY)
HASHING =
ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION (CAN'T GO BACK FROM HASH TO PASSWORD)
MD5
SHA1
RAINBOW TABLES : LISTS OF HASHES

Trainer 200
Risk : chance that threat will EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY
Vulnerability : weakness
Threat eg virus
Transfer : INSURE $$$
Avoid : DO SOMETHING ELSE
Accept : DO IT ANYWAY
Mitigate : Take action to strengthen our defences
Quantum cryptography : research phase : advanced
Separation of duty : CLEARLY DEFINED JOB ROLES
Job Rotation : ensures a) ONE PERSON NOT ENTRENCHED b) MULTIPLE TRAINED FOR 1 ROLE : GOOD IF KEY PERSON IS MISSING
Mandatory vacation : force HOLIDAY IN BLOCK
AUDITING : CHECKING ALL WORK : GOOD IF YOU'RE NOT THERE!
SYMMETRIC : ONE KEY, SAME KEY TO ENCRYPT/DECRYPT, FAST, NOT VERY SECURE
SESSION KEY : SYMMETRIC KEY LASTS 10 MINUTES
AES
CCMP
BLOWFISH
TWOFISH
DES
3DES
RC4
TKIP
ASYMMETRIC : 2 KEYS, PRIVATE/PUBLIC, SLOW, SECURE!
CERTIFICATE : HOLD YOUR (PUBLIC) KEY
SIGN : WITH YOUR PRIVATE KEY
VALIDATE SIGNATURE : WITH SIGNER'S PUBLIC KEY
SIGNATURE OF A FILE ==> 1) HASH 2) ENCRYPT HASH WITH PRIVATE KEY ===> NOW THIS FILE IS 'SIGNED' (ENCRYPTED HASH WE CALL THE 'SIGNATURE')
DH DIFFIE HELLMAN
EL GAMOL ???
ECC MOBILE PHONES
DHE DIFFIE HELLMAN EPHEMERAL ((EPHEMERAL ==> TEMPORARY))
RSA
HASHING
ONE WAY ENCRYPTION (CAN'T DECRYPT OTHER WAY)
RAINBOW TABLES : OF KNOWN HASHES
COLLISION
ETHERNET ==> CSMA/CD COLLISION DETECTION (PACKETS CAN COLLIDE ON ETHERNET NETWORK)
WIFI ==> CSMA/CA COLLISION AVOIDANCE : NO COLLISIONS ON WIFI (BEFORE SEND, CHECK NO ONE ELSE IS TRANSMITTING)
BIRTHDAY ATTACK : 2 FILES CAN HAVE SAME HASH : ATTACKER CAN USE THIS TO GET PAST DEFENCES (( COLLISION (HASH))
PORTS = CHANNEL INTO IP
25 SMTP : SEND EMAIL
110 POP : EMAIL IN
143 IMAP : EMAIL IN (COMPLEX)
GEOLOCATION : KNOW LOCATION FROM YOUR IP
SWITCH
STP : SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL : AUTO-STOP LOOPS IN SWITCH
LOOPBACK : TEST THAT NETWORK CARD IS WORKING OK AND IP INSTALLED OK
PING 127.0.0.1
PING LOCALHOST (PING MYSELF)
PING ::1 IPV6 LOOPBACK
ACCESS CONTROL
MAC : MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL : FILES HAVE PERMISSION SET BY GOVERNMENT EG TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED (NOT FREE TO CHANGE)
DACL : DISCRETIONARY : REGULAR NTFS PERMISSIONS : FREE TO CHANGE THEM
NTFS PERMISSIONS
FULL CONTROL
MODIFY
READ
EXECUTE
WRITE
LIST FOLDERS
SHARE PERMISSION (3)

RAT REMOTE ACCESS TROJAN
BPA BUSINESS PARTNER AGREEMENT : BOARDROOM LEVEL : FINANCIAL AGREEMENT
ISA ==> TECHNICAL AGREEMENT : 2 COMPANIES WORK TOGETHER ** LEGAL **
MOU : MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING : GUIDELINES FOR WORKING TOGETHER
MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION ==> both servers swap certificates and verify each other's identity using 802.1X transport behind the scenes (automatic)
