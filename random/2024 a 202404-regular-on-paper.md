## productivity

```
Get To Action
Failing Is One Of Lifes Greatest Teachers
Get into the habit of putting actions in your calendar.
Every Friday or Saturday, I plan my activities for the next week.
Every evening, after work, I review my priorities for the next day and move things around as needed.
And every end of the month, I write down my goals, both professionally and personally, for the next month.
I try to be as specific as possible.
How much mass do I want to put on?
How much money do I want to make?
How many new followers do I want to have?
When you have goals you firmly believe in and you review them at least once every week, you align your plans with your actions.
Journal your heart out.
Do things for others..
```
