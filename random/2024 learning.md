## websites

Home https://philanderson.uk

have one master site ... to link to all other sites ... with archive links etc

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk another beautiful ready-made site, love this one!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/mysite video editor website with good blog as well, like the fonts etc and simplity of this site - yes I like it!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/mysite/blog  video editor website with good blog as well, like the fonts etc and simplity of this site - yes I like it!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/my-site-1 another fine and simple ready-made website, good to go!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philanderson-uk-2 super basic skeleton, nothing here

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ideaftest01 interesting shopping site - an ok start, but it's a bit old fashioned and lacking in some things ... maybe erase this one!!!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/ot-enables-u one of the first sites I ever built!

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/consulting this was an interesting one for philanderson consulting !

https://philanderson881.wixsite.com/philipandersoncv2 here is one I could turn into an online CV!!!


## reviewing payment methods and options for online shops

- Stripe YES
- Shoppy Possibly
- Shopify seems expensive at 5pm for basic and 19pm for normal plan
- Wix plans from 4 per month but sites with payment options start from 15/m which seems expensive
  - £22 plan to accept payments, seems a bit costly at present

## app ideas

### regular route joe

Use AI to alert a user when their regular route is down - is this possible? Would have to tap into the regular google maps or apple maps route of the user ... then calculate the regular trip time ... then calculate today the trip time ... then see if there is a faster route ... then let user know

## learning goals and ideas

exciting goal 
... aws to build servers ... free!
... azure to build servers ...
... build servers with no gui
... build servers with gui using the hyperv feature ie virtual machines with hyperv which can build another virtual machine on top
... build stuff fully scripted
... can I build some gui web apps 
... can i test out a gui web app ... how would i do that ? 
... are there command line tools which i can use to test a web app
... or can i build a robot to click on a web site for me? ... a specific tool ... or general ai?
... it would be nice if I could just have a button to click and watch a robot go through and launch and click through all of my work , for sure! ... so I can just kick back and make a video of all of my work , for sure ...

Netlify functions with mongo ... use Realm to create an endpoint which runs code to read db when you hit the end point

Bun
Bun is faster than
Node
Yarn
Deno
Bun also has built in
Nodemon (don’t need this as is has a built in watch mode)
Dotenv (don’t need this as it reads .env files by default)
Compiling eg reading .js, .ts, .jsx, etc so no babel, tsc etc required
Bundling so no esbuild, webpack or parcel
Jest-compatible test runner so don’t need dependencies to write unit tests


bun install

bun test

const server = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response(“Welcome to Bun!”);

## Jewish Christians

```

For example we celebrate:

His death, burial and resurrection and His blood at  "Feast of Passover" ,

He paid for our sin "Feast of Unleavened bread"

He gave us His Spirit at "Feast of Pentacost."

We shout , blow trumpets and warn  people He is returning soon at "Feast of Trumpets"

We spend a day solely praying to realign our hearts to God/Yahweh ready for our personal judgement at "Feast of Atonement"

We spend 8 days  feasting, partying, dancing, and having joy celebrating Gods 7 day creation , the coming marriage of Christ and the Bride (us the church) and the coming 1000yr reign and new heaven and earth.

## Astronomy


### Asteroid Missions


2023 returning Osiris-Rex from Asteroid Bennu with samples to earth

2016 launched Osiris-Rex to Asteroid Bennu

## Search For Life

```
Venus
Venus may have life!
Scientists have discovered sulphur on Venus which can be produced by volcanic but it doesn't look like volcanically generated sulphur.
They also find hydrogen sulphide H2S and sulphur dioxide. These are incompatible ie when they combine or are present together, then they will naturally react together and eliminate. So it's a puzzle that they both exist. The only solution is that both molecules are being created by something. The answer is life! Life forms are creating both molecules, so is there life on Venus? In the clouds of Venus??? Puzzling!!!
```


### Planetary Exploration - Mars

Curiosity is the Mars Rover. It is currently driving round Mars.

### Political Conflict

```
Judea and Samaria
Terms used by enemies of Israel
solidarity with Palestine
Israeli 'occupation'
Israeli 'occupation' soldiers shot dead a child
#FreePalestine
#Apartheid
Pillaging Natural Palestinian resources like the dead sea
handicapped victims of Apartheid atrocities
Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians
83 Palestinian children killed by apartheid Israelthis year
#boycottIsrael
Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
