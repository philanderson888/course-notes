## physics

```
Neutrino
Cosmic ray
Lepton half spin involved in all forces except strong
Muon has charge
Tau lepton
Neutrino is uncharged lepton interacts only via weak force
Electron neutrino
Muon neutrino
Tau neutrino
Boson has integer spin
Gluon
Higgs boson zero spin gives particles mass
Photon spin one
W exchange particle for weak force
Z exchange particle for weak force
Fermion spin half
Meson has charge strangeness spin
Kaon one of quarks is strange
Baryon has charge strangeness spin
Hyperon is baryon containing strange quark
Omega 3 strange quarks
Gluon is exchange boson of strong force
Graviton spin 2, hypothetical
Hadron consists of quarks held by strong force
Neutron spin half one up quark two down quarks

Electron. Spin half charge minus one
Positron

Nucleon
Proton
Neutron

Anti neutron
Anti proton

Quark has spin half and experiences all 4 forces
Charm
Strange
All such particles have strangeness l
Up
Down
Top
Bottom
Anti quark

Hadron
Meson has quark and anti quark
Pion = Pi Meson has two up or two down quarks can be positive negative or neutral
Proton charge positive spin half has two up one down quark

Baryon is hadron of 3 quarks

Alpha is helium
Beta is electron
Gamma high energy light

Standard model
Links strong weak and electromagnetic forces
does not include gravity
Higgs boson gives particles mass

Forces
Strong
Particles having colour charge
Weak
Exchange particles are Bosons W and Z
Gravitational
Higgs field?
Electromagnetic
Photon is exchange boson spin one

Parton sub nuclear particles
Quarks
Gluons

pauli exclusion principle 
- fermion has 1/2 spin or 3/2 spin
- electron has 1/2 spin up or down
- boson
- superposition
- lepton single particle
   - electron
   - muon
   - tau
- hadron
  - proton 2 up one down quark
  - neutron 1 up 2 down quark


quark up / down / top / bottom / strange / charm

quark up , top, charm all have 2/3
quark down , bottom, strange all have 1/3

boson has integer spin
- strong nuclear force
- weak nuclear force
- gravitational force

## school physics

atom 

molecule

mass number is protons + neutrons

atomic number is protons

atomic mass

formula mass

mole in grams

isotope is same protons different neutrons

conservation of mass

conservation of momentum

conservation of angular momentum

newton force = - force

newton state continue as is unless force acts to change it

## chemistry

concentration is mass of solute in solution measured in moles per cubic metre

mass = moles *
