Judea and Samaria
Terms used by enemies of Israel
solidarity with Palestine
Israeli 'occupation'
Israeli 'occupation' soldiers shot dead a child

#boycottIsrael
Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.
