## scripting

```
List physical drives , their size and type eg ssd or sata
List logical drives, their size, filing system , and on which logical drive they reside
Turn it into a service to run on launch
For each logical drive list folders over a given size eg 10mb
For each folder over that given size list any files over a given size eg 2MB
Have the ability to exclude certain file types from the search
Also have the ability to exclude carts in folders by name from the search over a given size

## functional programming

```
Allows you to write
    Compressed code
    Predictable code
    Easier to test

It
    Combines Pure Functions
    Uses a declarative approach rather than an imperative approach
    Declarative
    Imperative

It Avoids
    Shared state
    Mutable (changeable) data

Functional programming key terms

    Pure functions

        are Deterministic (output is predictable given the same input)

        Have no side effects

    Function composition

        combine two functions

        Avoid shared state

        shared state force knowing the full history of a variable

    Immutability

        Cannot change the object to which you are bound

        But can still change the properties of the object

        Side effects are interactions which affect other areas and do not just stay within the confines of the function

    Imperative

        Answers 'how to do' this problem with workflow control

    Declarative

        Looks at 'what to do' with data flow

        Disadvantage of functional programming

        No purely functional 'weak hash map'

```
