## app ideas

https://www.vuemastery.com/account learn big time from this

Does my iphone know when i am using my headphones or not?  Can I ping to a back end?  Can i get it to prompt a notification every 20 minutes during working hours if I am not!  To remind me to play youtube watch later!!! Would be good!! Also can it listen to the environment to tell if I am on a work meeting or not, at least talking!!! Would be good!!!
