solidjs builds fast UI with max reactivity in 2018 - no virtual dom but builds native JS instead same as Svelte.  Tiny at 7KB.  Almost as fast as vanilla js 

crdt conflict-free replicated data type is a data structure that is replicated across multiple computers on a network - discrepancies are automatically resolved and convergence is guaranteed ... used by redis and cosmosdb ... idea is that all merges are allowed through and conflicts are resolved by going forwards rather than backwards ... also zed uses this

yjs exposes shared types over synchronised crdt ocal peer-to-peer systems.  data can be stored locally and automatically syncs when the internet connection is restored

gossip protocol relies on peers to spread data - there is no central repository

epidemic = gossip protocol is fully peer to peer and has no central repository 

zed is a code editor built on rust and uses GPUI which uses all GPU cores and cpu cores together effectively

zod are orm maps built on typescript

svelte is faster than nextjs

svelte does front end and sveltekit builds a full stack app talking to back end as well

### google deployment using prodspec and 

problem is that of M infrastructure providers with N service models producing M X N solutions to be maintained

prodspec creates an interim `intent model` which sits in the middle and creates `M + N` solutions to be maintained

### 202410 bash

cht.sh

bash is bourne again shell

ps process status

ls -1 list just names one by one

ls -R list files in subfolders

top top processes  

.bash_profile loads when terminal loads

.zprofile and .zshrc load when zshell loads


```bash
chmod u+x  just for me
chmod +rwx just for me
chmod a+rwx for everyone
man rm
ls -1
ls -a # hidden files
find ~/github -name \\*zshrc\\* # find files containing this name in this folder
open . # opens finder
stdin 0
stdout 1
stderr 2
```

```bash
alias myip=curl 1.2.3.4
function mkcd() { mkdir -p "$@" && cd "&@" }
function gitpush() { git add . && git commit -m "$@" && git push }

Next edit the file ~ /.bash_profile

alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"
alias chrome=open -a "Google Chrome"
alias edge=open -a "Microsoft Edge"

export PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"
source "/Users/tech-a21/.aliases.sh"  # General aliases and functions defined by me
Now opening a new terminal should contain these new scripts
```

```bash
show hidden files and folder ... defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE && killall Finder
function gitTag(){ git tag -a "$1" && -m "$2" && git push -origin tags } 
sudo find / -name \\*bashrc\\*
open .    opens window in finder
open -a "Google Chrome" mysite.html
Edit ~/.bash_profile file and add the following line alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"

.bash_profile is where we set the terminal profile launch settings

.bash_profile / .zsh_profile etc

launchctl setenv name environmentvariable
ps process status
ps aux lists all processes
ps -A lists all processes
top lists top processes
exe does not exist in linux - any file can be executed if it has the 'execute' permission
```

environment variables

```bash
printenv will show environment variables
env will show environment variables 
printenv PATH show just PATH
echo $PATH show just PATH
export field=value add to environment values so now printenv field returns value
export name=envaironmentvariable
launchctl setenv field value permanently adds to environment variables
```

crontab schedule jobs

```bash
sudo crontab -e schedules a cron job
sudo crontab -e // i . (insert mode) // minutes hours days month dayoftheweek path-to-script.sh eg 00 08 * * * // :wq to save and exit
```

vi editor

```bash
vi myFile.txt
vi i opens file in insert mode 
vi escape :wq save and quit
vi escape :q quit without saving
vi :return next line
vi :space next page
vi :q quit
vi :w previous page

### 202410 streaming

dash dynamic adaptive streaming over http - best for high quality and best for on demand streaming. used by shaka, vlc, videojs, libdash

libdash provides open source oop library to mpeg dash streaming for live and vod

scte-35 marker indicates where other content eg adverts can be inserted into a video stream

watermarking helps to protect streaming content 

abr adaptive bitrate streaming assumes that lowering the bitrate is more important than letting the user experience buffering, rendering the most suitable content renditions

rendition is a version of a stream at a given resolution for streaming at a given bitrate

manifest defines files to be fetched as part of adaptive bitrate streaming abr stream

playready drm by microsoft created 2007

widevine drm bought by google in 2010

cpm cost per mille is the money an advertiser will pay to have 1000 of their adverts shown eg $10 is average cpm on youtube

csai client side ad insertion

ssai server side ad insertion

addressable advertising customises adverts

live to vod provides extended restart after the live stream finishes

psb public service broadcaster

spi stream performance index is an overall figure which indicates the health of a stream

### 202410 powershell

get-vm

get-vm -name x | format-list *

get-vm | format name, state, groups

move-vm -name x -newvmhost y

vmgroup of vms

vmgroup of type vmcollection is a group of actual vms

vmgroup of type management is a group of vm collection groups (which are groups of vms)

new-vmgroup -name x -grouptype vmcollectiontype

get-vmgroup -name x

add-vmgroupmember -vmgroup x -vm y


## windows infrastructure

vm fairness moves vms to the least uses hosts.  vms are moved if cpu or ram exceeds 60/70/80 percent based on cpu average over last 5 minutes or current ram now and is checked every 30 minutes

vm sequencing determines the order that vms start up or shut down

storage pool is two or more drives connected together

storage spaces is use of a storage pool to create duplicate copies of data so if one data store fails, the duplicate is available

storage quality of service monitors storage performance, noisy neighbours, 

noisy neighbour consumes resources on a multitenant host

scale out file server is designed to be scalable to avoid bottlenecks, scaling out nodes, bandwidth and performance

clustered file server has one share available on one node at any one time

storage replica enables replication of volumes between servers, clusters or sites to facilitate disaster recovery.  immediate synchronous replication on lan, delayed asynchronous replication across wan

synchronous replication is guaranteed

asynchronous replication is slower and not guaranteed

dedup storage deduplication eliminates duplicate blocks of data

virtual receive side scaling allows multiple virtual cpus to serve one network adapter, to prevent bottlenecks of transmission at that adapter

nic teaming groups multiple network adapters together

.vmcx virtual machine config file

.vhdx virtual machine storage file

.avdx virtual machine delta 

.avhds virtual machine shared hard disk

.vmrs vm running state is equivalent of ram
