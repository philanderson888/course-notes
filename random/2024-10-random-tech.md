zod is perhaps the best array and object library

lodash is a good lightweight solution for dealing with arrays and objects

ndarray is multidimensional array

math.js works with matrices and multidimensional arrays 

numJs is inspired by numPy for simple mathematical calculations

signal is a listener over a primitive

```js
// npm install signals
const {signal } = require('signals');
let count = signal(0);
count.observe(value => console.log(value));
count(10);
```

webtransport over http/3 replaces websockets



```
// package.json
// "@fails-components/webtransport": "^1.0.4",
// "@fails-components/webtransport-transport-http3-quiche": "^1.0.4",
async function sendData(url, data) {
    const wt = new WebTransport(url);
    const writable = await wt.createUnidirectionalStream();
    const writer = writable.getWriter();
    await writer.write(data);
    await writer.close();
}
```

quic by google enables multiple streams within one connection and also has zero round trip time 0-RTT - it's a wrapper over udp 

0-RTT zero round trip time

solidjs builds fast UI with max reactivity in 2018 - no virtual dom but builds native JS instead same as Svelte.  Tiny at 7KB.  Almost as fast as vanilla js 

crdt conflict-free replicated data type is a data structure that is replicated across multiple computers on a network - discrepancies are automatically resolved and convergence is guaranteed ... used by redis and cosmosdb ... idea is that all merges are allowed through and conflicts are resolved by going forwards rather than backwards ... also zed uses this

yjs exposes shared types over synchronised crdt ocal peer-to-peer systems.  data can be stored locally and automatically syncs when the internet connection is restored

gossip protocol relies on peers to spread data - there is no central repository

epidemic = gossip protocol is fully peer to peer and has no central repository 

zed is a code editor built on rust and uses GPUI which uses all GPU cores and cpu cores together effectively

zod are orm maps built on typescript

svelte is faster than nextjs

svelte does front end and sveltekit builds a full stack app talking to back end as well

npm-check-updates can upgrade package.json dependencies

partykit collaboration software hosted on cloudflare

hsts http strict transport security ensures https is enforced

coords.accuracy altitude heading latitude longitude speed

ctlKey true if control key was held down during the event

devicemotion is acceleration in x y z direction and also rotationRate alpha beta gamma

deviceorientation is alpha beta gamma position

dtd frameset contains frames, strict like xml, transitional has older html

## 202410 nocode and low-code

webflow use design to build a website

build a website 1) repeatable design 2) break page into sections 3) great headings eg hero has 1 or 2 columns  4) small paragraph, image/video to compliment the heading 5) repeatable section to explain your website in a little bit more detail 6) call to action 7) content ... with colours have just 4 - black through to white and two accent colours ... with font just have one font on whole website ... use dynamic heading size, flexible cards, SVG icons which highlight with CSS, snap scrolling which snaps next portion of your site into view quickly at the right position, scale up or down

airtable nocode and low-code database

webflow best for designers

wix - build a fresh site in moments

  background("aqua");
  //circle in the center with a width of 100
  circle(200,200,100);
  
  
  //when mouse button is pressed, circles turn black
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }

### google deployment using prodspec and 

problem is that of M infrastructure providers with N service models producing M X N solutions to be maintained

prodspec creates an interim `intent model` which sits in the middle and creates `M + N` solutions to be maintained

### 202410 bash

cht.sh

bash is bourne again shell

ps process status

ls -1 list just names one by one

ls -R list files in subfolders

top top processes¬†¬†

.bash_profile loads when terminal loads

.zprofile and .zshrc load when zshell loads


```bash
chmod u+x  just for me
chmod +rwx just for me
chmod a+rwx for everyone
man rm
ls -1
ls -a # hidden files
find ~/github -name \\*zshrc\\* # find files containing this name in this folder
open . # opens finder
stdin 0
stdout 1
stderr 2
```

```bash
alias myip=curl 1.2.3.4
function mkcd() { mkdir -p "$@" && cd "&@" }
function gitpush() { git add . && git commit -m "$@" && git push }

Next edit the file ~ /.bash_profile

alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"
alias chrome=open -a "Google Chrome"
alias edge=open -a "Microsoft Edge"

export PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"
source "/Users/tech-a21/.aliases.sh"  # General aliases and functions defined by me
Now opening a new terminal should contain these new scripts
```

```bash
show hidden files and folder ... defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE && killall Finder
function gitTag(){ git tag -a "$1" && -m "$2" && git push -origin tags } 
sudo find / -name \\*bashrc\\*
open .    opens window in finder
open -a "Google Chrome" mysite.html
Edit ~/.bash_profile file and add the following line alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"

.bash_profile is where we set the terminal profile launch settings

.bash_profile / .zsh_profile etc

launchctl setenv name environmentvariable
ps process status
ps aux lists all processes
ps -A lists all processes
top lists top processes
exe does not exist in linux - any file can be executed if it has the 'execute' permission
```

environment variables

```bash
printenv will show environment variables
env will show environment variables 
printenv PATH show just PATH
echo $PATH show just PATH
export field=value add to environment values so now printenv field returns value
export name=envaironmentvariable
launchctl setenv field value permanently adds to environment variables
```

crontab schedule jobs

```bash
sudo crontab -e schedules a cron job
sudo crontab -e // i . (insert mode) // minutes hours days month dayoftheweek path-to-script.sh eg 00 08 * * * // :wq to save and exit
```

vi editor

```bash
vi myFile.txt
vi i opens file in insert mode 
vi escape :wq save and quit
vi escape :q quit without saving
vi :return next line
vi :space next page
vi :q quit
vi :w previous page
vi :h help
```

libdash provides open source oop library to mpeg dash streaming for live and vod

scte-35 marker indicates where other content eg adverts can be inserted into a video stream

watermarking helps to protect streaming content 

abr adaptive bitrate streaming assumes that lowering the bitrate is more important than letting the user experience buffering, rendering the most suitable content renditions

rendition is a version of a stream at a given resolution for streaming at a given bitrate

manifest defines files to be fetched as part of adaptive bitrate streaming abr stream
