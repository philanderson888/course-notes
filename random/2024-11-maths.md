## maths terms

lower bound

upper bound

significant figures 

congruent means same size and shape

similar means identical in shape but can differ in scale/size eg 2 times bigger, length of sides are in same ratio, area is in ratio, volume is in ratio, etc

pythagoras a squared plus b squared is c squared

sine rule area equals half side a times side b times sin angle C

area of trapezium is half (sum of both parallel sides) times vertical height

volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height of cylinder

surface area of a cylinder is (2 times pi times radius times height ) plus (2 times pi times radius squared)

volume of a pyramid is one third times base area times vertical height

volume of a cone is one third of pi times radius squared times vertical height

surface area of a cone is base area plus cone area which is (pi times radius squared) plus (pi times radius times long edge (not vertical height!))

volume of sphere is 4 thirds pi times radius cubed

surface area of sphere = 4 pi r squared

volume of frustrum is volume of full cone minus volume of top cone


circle area is pi r squared

Cosine Rule: a squared = b squared + c squared - 2bc cosine A

Sine Rule: sin A over A = Sin B over B

Volume of sphere is 4/3 PI R cubed

Volume of cone is 1/3 PI R squared x height

## maths terms

factorisation

quadratic equations in powers of x squared

simultaneous equations

coefficient

translation moving from a to b

reflection in a mirror

rotation about a point or by an angle

enlargement

bearings is angle and distance

rationalise denominator

fibonacci 

sets : x is a member of A 

A n B    intersection

A u B    union

v = u + at

s = ut + 1/2 a t squared

v2 = u2 + 2as

lowest common multiple eg 2, 10 => 10

highest common factor 6,9 => 3

prime factors  

indices

x to power m * x to power n = x to power (m+n)

x to power m / x to power n = x to power (m-n)

(x to power m) to power n = x to power (m*n)

1/(x to power n) = x to power (-n)

x to power 1/2 = square root of x

x to power (1/n) = nth root of x

x to power (m/n) = nth root of x to the power m

surds have irrational roots

irrational cannot be broken down into whole number

root of (ab) = (root of a) * (root of b)

root of (a/b) = (root of a) / (root of b)

floating point number is mantissa * radix to the power exponent
