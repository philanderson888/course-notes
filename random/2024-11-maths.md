## maths terms

lower bound

upper bound

significant figures 

congruent means same size and shape

similar means identical in shape but can differ in scale/size eg 2 times bigger, length of sides are in same ratio, area is in ratio, volume is in ratio, etc

pythagoras a squared plus b squared is c squared

sine rule area equals half side a times side b times sin angle C

area of trapezium is half (sum of both parallel sides) times vertical height

volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height of cylinder

surface area of a cylinder is (2 times pi times radius times height ) plus (2 times pi times radius squared)

volume of a pyramid is one third times base area times vertical height

volume of a cone is one third of pi times radius squared times vertical height

surface area of a cone is base area plus cone area which is (pi times radius squared) plus (pi times radius times long edge (not vertical height!))

volume of sphere is 4 thirds pi times radius cubed

surface area of sphere = 4 pi r squared

volume of frustrum is volume of full cone minus volume of top cone
