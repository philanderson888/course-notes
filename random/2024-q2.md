## Bible People

Mark = John Mark = evangelist .... Book of Mark is the first gospel ... Started the church in Egypt ... Martyred in Alexandria AD68 dragged by horses ... Missions with St Paul to Cyprus ... Disappointed Paul in early ministry by not coming on the work .... Paul called him a ‘Son’ later on

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation
Life
        - When does life begin?
            - videos of a baby developing

He paid for our sin "Feast of Unleavened bread"

He gave us His Spirit at "Feast of Pentacost."

We shout , blow trumpets and warn  people He is returning soon at "Feast of Trumpets"

We spend a day solely praying to realign our hearts to God/Yahweh ready for our personal judgement at "Feast of Atonement"

We spend 8 days  feasting, partying, dancing, and having joy celebrating Gods 7 day creation , the coming marriage of Christ and the Bride (us the church) and the coming 1000yr reign and new heaven and earth.

Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

# view differences before git add
git diff
# view differences for one file
git diff HEAD file

# once in the file, navigate with
:return  next line
:space   next page
:q       quit
:w       previous page
:h       help

# check differences before git push
git diff --cached
```

### gitk

gitk - viewing proposed changes

```powershell
# Run gitk and view proposed changes
gitk
```

### GitHub Desktop

Use GitHub Desktop at [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) to visually see all changes first

## Hiding Secrets

Use this guide [https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25) to create a config file with the API keys in it, which is not published to github because it's inside the .gitignore file as well.

### git add

```powershell
# add file to staging area so that files are now tracked
gid add <file>
git add .
git add . --interactive to view changes as you push them

# show differences in files we have just added to the staging area
git diff --cached 

# check differences before commit
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
```

### git reset

```powershell
# before committing, git reset (no full stop) reverses the effect of git add
git reset
```

### git status

```powershell
# show differences between your folder and the staging area
git status
```

### git commit

```powershell
# commit our work as a point in time 'commit' to a local repository
git commit -m "Sample commit"

```

### .gitignore

to add a file to .gitignore which somehow is already being tracked, do the following

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree file
```



## Working With GitHub Online

### git clone

git clone can be used to clone a repository

```powershell
# copy a fresh copy of a remote repository down to the local machine, and initialise it ready for editing
git clone
```

### git remote

```powershell
# validate set up
git remote
# show url set up
git remote -v
git remote get-url --all origin
# set remote url
git remote set-url origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/test-project-3>
# or
git remote add origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/testproject>
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### git push

```powershell
# to see a list of changed files before run git push
git diff --stat --cached origin/master

# see what will happen before you push
git push --dry-run   

# to set up git push one must first define the name of the remote branch to be created
git push --set-upstream origin -branch-name-
# push from local to remote repository
git push
```

### git pull

git pulls remote repo latest changes down into my local repo and merges changes

```
# pull down files from remote to local repository
git pull
```

### git config

git config can be used to configure which github account you are logged into

query user account with

```
git config --global -l    to list and check
```

Set user account details with the following

```
git config --global user.name 'Phil Anderson' 
git config --global user.email 'phil@anderson.com'
```

reset user and begin again

```
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

### git branch

The branches that need to be created are

- Master
- Dev
- Feature Branch

```
# create a branch
git branch branch_name

# create a new sub-branch off dev
git checkout -b new-branch-name dev

# delete a local-only branch 
git checkout master
git branch -D branch_name

# delete a branch if it's been pushed to remote repo also
git checkout master
git branch -d branch_name

# delete the branch you are on, and push this deletion to GitHub also
git push origin --delete branch_name

# delete a remote branch
git checkout master
git push origin --delete remote-branch-name


```

#### rename a branch

```powershell
git checkout old_name
git branch -m new_name
git push origin -u new_name
git push origin --delete old_name
```



### git checkout

```powershell
# move from one branch into another
git checkout branch_name
```

View the files in a particular commit

```powershell
# obtain the ID of the intended commit
git log
# move to this commit and look at the files
git checkout id
```

```powershell
# view all branches including hidden ones
git checkout -a
```

 
### git merge dev

If a dev branch has been updated in github then we need to bring our dev and feature branches into line with the dev branch online.

These steps will pull down and merge all changes.

```powershell
# Create branch dev if it does not exist
git branch dev

# Move to dev branch
git checkout dev

# pull down changes from dev on github to dev on local
git pull origin dev

# check code has pulled down
ls 

// switch to feature branch
git checkout phil-feature-branch-01

// merge changes from dev into this branch
git merge dev
```

## Viewing And Undoing Changes

### git log

git log can be used to view previous commits

```powershell
# view snapshots (commits)
git log

# git log with branching
git log --graph

# git log but summary data only
git log --oneline
```

### git reflog

```powershell
### git reflog

git reflog # display a list of commits with indexes.
```

### git reset —soft

Undo changes and reset the state of the disk back to a given commit point

```powershell
git reset --soft  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git reset —hard

Use this with extreme care as it wipes the files from your hard drive and they become irrecoverable

```powershell
# reset files on your hard disk back to your last commit point
git reset HEAD --hard 

# resets the files on disk to the state registered by this snapshot
git reset --hard  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git clean

Git clean can be used to remove untracked directories, which may still be hanging around and not been deleted properly when a checkout takes place and we no longer want those directories to be present

```powershell
// force removal of untracked directories
git clean -fd
```

### github tagging

GitHub tagging can allow you to commit a project at a certain state in time, and then preserve that state with definite tags in order to be able to recover the project again if needed.

This also works with GitHub releases.

Commits should be finished first, then tagging is done second.

```powershell
# show all tags
git tag
git show

# add a tag
git tag mytag

git tag -a "version-1.0" -m "detailed message about this version" 
git push origin --tags

```

## Other Git Commands

### Fixing a merge conflict

```powershell
# show conflict
git status
```

edit .md file and find `<<<<< ==== and >>>>` markers, edit and remove them

```powershell
# push changes
git push
```

### Change Git User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. You may be denied permissions to push and have to log out of the current user. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Protecting The Master Branch

Once we have created both master and dev branches we should protect the master from direct updates. All updates should now be done via the dev branch. Once updated, then a pull request gets submitted to allow work to be merged from the dev branch into the master branch, after approval.

1. Select master branch
2. Go into master branch settings
3. Choose 'Branches' on the left hand menu
4. Choose 'Add Rule'
5. Tick 'Require Pull Request Before Merging' and type in the name of the branch, ie 'master'
6. The master branch is now protected from direct updates.

### [Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

### Renaming A Branch

```powershell
# if you are on the branch you want to rename
git branch -m new-name
# if you are on another branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
# delete the old local and push the new branch
git push origin :old-name new-name
# point to new upstream branch
git push origin -u new-name
```

## Changing Github User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Tag

```powershell
# list
git tag 
# add 
git tag -a TagName -m "message"
# push
git push origin --tags
```

## SSH

If you have set up SSH keys the commands with `https://` would be changed to

```powershell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:philanderson888/repo.git 
# or
git remote add origin git@github.com:philanderson888/testproject
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### Locating your SSH keys

SSH keys can be located at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or repo, settings, SSH keys 

### Keygen walkthrough

## Github With SSH

with GitBash

```powershell
ssh-keygen
# copy the public key to git respository
eval $(ssh-agent)
# add key with response 'identity added'
ssh-add my_private_key
# list 
ssh-add -l
# log in (responds with 'logged in as ..')
ssh -T git@..
```

powershell version

```powershell
# open Git bash shell
cd ~/.ssh
ls
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Generating public/private rsa key pair to file /Users/..../.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "philanderson888@hotmail.com"
# MAC key is saved in 
# /Users/apple/.ssh/id_rsa or change name of path and file
# Windows key is saved in 
# C:\Users\...\.ssh\ssh-key-01
# start the ssh-agent service to run in the background (Windows needs GitBash)
eval $(ssh-agent -s) 
# add key to ssh agent (use GitBash on Windows)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# verify keys added
ssh-add -l
# copy key to github (use GitBash on Windows)
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# add key (MAC)
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# or just copy then paste key into repo settings -> RSA Key -> New
# Finally to get this to work reset the origin to ssh 
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git 
# git push 
git push origin master
# Notice that if we get a git push - permission denied notice when we know the keys are already set up correctly then we can type in the eval and ssh-add commands again.
```

CREATING YOUR OWN CERTIFICATES IN A PKI INFRASTRUCTURE


PUBLIC CERTIFICATES

    VALID FOR USE ON THE INTERNET 

    ANYONE IN THE WORLD CAN VIEW YOUR PUBLIC CERTIFICATE
    AND VERIFY YOU AND THE COMPANY EG VERISIGN WHICH
    ISSUED YOUR CERTIFICATE

    COST MONEY EG $300

    REQUIRED FOR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS EG PUBLIC HTTPS://
    WEB SITE

PRIVATE CERTIFICATE

    GENERATED BY YOU ON A FREE WINDOWS SERVER

    INSTALL 'CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY' (CA) ROLE

    ==> ISSUE CERTIFICATES INTERNALLY 

    ((YOUR PRIVATE CERTIFCATES NOT VALID FOR USE
    ON INTERNET))  ==> OTHERS 'NOT TRUSTED'
            CERTIFICATE MESSAGE

CREATING A PRIVATE PKI FOR YOUR OWN COMPANY

    1. INSTALL 'ROOT' (FIRST) CA (CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY)
            MACHINE

    2. IF YOU HAVE A BIG COMPANY, INSTALL SUBORDINATE
        CA MACHINES (ALSO CALL THEM 'ISSUING'
        SERVERS

    3. CLIENTS CAN NOW 'ENROL' OR 'REQUEST' CERTIFICATES
        FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES

        AUTO-ENROL MEANS COMPUTER CAN AUTOMATICALLY
        APPROVE AND ISSUE CERTIFICATES

        MANUAL ENROL : HUMAN BEING HAVE TO MANUALLY
            APPROVE REQUESTS

REVOKING A CERTIFICATE

    MUST BE ABLE TO PROVE A CERTIFICATE IS STILL VALID

    ON SERVER, CAN 'REVOKE' (NULLIFY) ANY CERTIFICATE

    PROVE TO CLIENTS THAT THEIR CERTIFICATE IS STILL GOOD

    TWO LISTS

    1)  CRL CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LIST : FULL LIST OF
        ALL 'REVOKED' (NULLIFIED) CERTIFICATES

        DELTA CRL : PARTIAL (UP-TO-DATE) LIST

    2)  ONLINE WEBSITE : OCSP (ONLINE CERTIFICATE
                   STATUS PROTOCOL)

        CHECK FOR JUST ONE CERTIFICATE : IS IT VALID?

    ESCROW = TRUSTED 3RD PARTY TO HOLD OUR CERTIFICATES
            IN CASE OF DISASTER

#### Risk Analysis Process


    1. IDENTIFY YOUR ASSETS
    
        Equipment of value
        Data ==> OF HIGHEST VALUE EVEN THOUGH
            MAYBE CAN'T PUT PRICE ON IT!
        People 
            Knowledge and Experience of 
            key personnel
        Building
    
       EXAM : AV ==> ASSET VALUE
    
    2. Identify Vulnerabilities / Weaknesses
    
    3. Identify Threats (Internal/External/Man-made/
                Natural)
    
    4. Probability Chart 
    
        % likelihood that a particuar threat
            will materialise and threaten
            a vulnerability
    
            eg 10% chance pothole x in road y
                   will generate an insurance
                   claim
    
        SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY
    
            $$$COST OF ONE OCCURRENCE		
    
        ARO ANNUAL RATE OF OCCURRENCE
    
            PREDICTED NUMBER OF TIMES A YEAR
            THIS WILL HAPPEN
    
        ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY
    
            $$$EXPECTED LOSSES IN 1 YEAR				
    
    5. IMPACT ANALYSIS : LOOKING AT COSTS ABOVE OR
        OTHER EVENTS WHICH CAN'T BE MEASURED
        WITH MONEY EG LOSS OF MORALE, MOTIVATION,
        LOSS OF FACE, LOSS OF REPUTATION ETC ...


    6. WHAT DO WE DO??? 
    
        NOTHING  IE LIVE WITH RISK (EG CROSSING ROAD)
    
        INSURE (TRANSFER) OUR RISK BY INSURING
            AGAINST LOSS EG FOOTBALLER INSURE
                    LEG
    
        PUT UP WARNING SIGNS AS DETERRENCE TO 
            ATTACKERS : PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
        
        AVOID THE RISK ALTOGETHER BY DOING SOMETHING
            ELSE (DON'T CROSS THE ROAD BUT USE
                THE TUNNEL!)
    
        SPEND SOME MONEY OR TAKE ACTION
    
            "MITIGATION" => TAKE ACTION TO 
                    MINIMISE OUR LOSS
    
            EG CREATE POLICIES, BUILD DEFENCES,
               EDUCATE USERS, ADVICE FROM EXPERTS,
               TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST
               POTENTIAL ATTACKER





































### Network Security Lab

#### Gaining Access To A Network

##### Class Lab

Spend 20 minutes or so listing and categorising all of the different types of physical and cyber threats to a business.  Be as specific as possible and let the class do the leading and the talking, and if necessary, some research!


#### NTFS And Share Permissions

##### Lab : NTFS and Share Permissions

1. On a server create a share.  
2. In `Active Directory` create two different groups eg `Accounting` and `ITSupport`.  
3. On the share, in the NTFS Security tab, create two folders and grant one access to one group (Accounting) and to the other folder grant access to the IT Support group. 
4. Create some users and place them in the appropriate groups.  
5. Check that the users have the correct access when they log in from a Windows client and try and access the share.






#### Virtual Online Router

https://emulator.tp-link.com/emulator_841hpv5_un/index.htm




#### Group Policy Management

Group policy is the central tool used to control all the Windows clients from the central domain controllers.  Windows uses a `multi-master` model so that the central policies are replicated to all domain controllers, and all Windows clients pick up these policies both at computer startup and also at user login, depending if the policy applies at startup or login.  

We can manage group policies in two ways

1. Local Computer

   Simply run `GPEDIT.msc` from a local computer

2. Server Group Policy Management

   This will affect the whole domain ie every computer joined to this domain, so it's important to know what you are doing!

   Server Manager => Tools => Group Policy Management.  Expand the forest, Domain and  the domain until the `Default Domain Policy` is showing.   If we click on the `Settings` tab in the middle of the page and choose `show all` we can expand and view the existing policy.

   To edit the policy, right click on `Default Domain Policy` and choose `Edit`.  We are now editing the policy.  

##### Lab - Password And Lockout Policy

1. Open Group Policy Editor
2. Find and edit the default domain policy
3. Open Computer, Windows, Security, Account, Password policy and set the following
   - Minimum length 10 characters
   - Expires every 30 days
   - Complex passwords enforced 
   - Minimum age 1 day
4. Open Computer, Windows, Security, Account, Account Lockout policy and set the following
   - 5 incorrect attempts are permitted after which lockout for 10 minutes
   - Reset the incorrect lockout count after 5 minutes

##### Lab - Publish A Printer

1. On the server using Print Management add a printer.  (Can just use the built-in printers on LPT1 port)
2. Share the printer and give it a simple name with no spaces eg `Brother2048`
3. In Group Policy edit the default domain policy then open Preferences, Control Panel, Printers and add a new printer.  Enter the share path to the printer as the path, for example \\<servername>\PrinterSharedName\.

##### Lab - Publish Software

1. Create a share eg C:\Share on Windows and share it as `Share`.
2. Add an msi file to the share for example Firefox from `https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release`  
3. In Group Policy, edit the default domain policy and choose `Computer, Policies, Software, Software Installation` and add a new package.
4. Browse to the `Share path` holding the MSI eg \\\ServerPhil\Share and select the package.  This is now ready for deployment.

#### DNS Labs














### Wireshark

##### Install Wireshark

Install Wireshark and analyse some packets travelling through the network

We can click on a Wireshark session to look at individual packets.  And every packet will have an Ethernet `source` and `destination` address just as per the Ethernet model above.  We can also inspect the payload.

As an interesting lab we can filter for `udp` traffic and then send a PING request to `8.8.8.8` address and look at the Wireshark data.   We can see that actually a PING request to Google (which is `8.8.8.8`) is just sending the alphabet there and back as a payload!  See if you can find it!

### WIFI labs



See ui.linksys.com labs for an example of SSID Broadcast and MAC filtering settings




##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part 1

As an indicator of how careful we have to be with `symmetric` encryption please run the following commands 

```powershell
# show wireless profile names
netsh wlan show profiles
# choose one
netsh wlan show profile name="name-of-wireless-profile" key=clear
```

You should see the WIFI password displayed in plain text.

If you are on a MAC then in the `terminal` please type

```bash
security find-generic-password -wa name-of-wireless-profile
```

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part II

Nobody uses default usernames and passwords these days - do they?

Well it's always worth a check!

Check your WIFI router model then head to `[routerpasswords.com](https://routerpasswords.com)`.  See what you can find!

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part III

For further study please visit `Kali Linux` on your laptop and run `wifite` and follow the trail . . .

### DEFENSE IN DEPTH

       MULTIPLE LAYERS OF SECURITY


#### STORAGE TYPES

DAS DIRECT ATTACHED STORAGE


ANYTHING DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO YOUR COMPUTER

    EG SATA DRIVE / SCSI DRIVE / IDE DRIVE



NAS NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE


NAS DRIVE 

    USE FOR 'SOHO' SMALL-OFFICE HOME-OFFICE

            (LESS THAN 10 USERS)

    USING RAID 5 TO STORE FILES

        
        RAID 0 STRIPING : VERY FAST : BUT
             PROBLEM IF ONE DRIVE FAILS YOU
             LOSE ALL YOUR DATA
        RAID 1 MIRRORING OF 2 DRIVES 
        RAID 5 3+ DRIVES WITH FAULT TOLERANCE : 
            IF ONE DRIVE FAILS THE DATA IS
            ALREADY 'STRIPED' ACROSS OTHER
            DRIVES SO YOUR DATA IS SAFE



SAN STORAGE AREA NETWORK


USED BY LARGE COMPANIES TO STORE DATA USING FIBER OR 10GBPS
    COPPER LINES TO LIGHNING-FAST STORAGE NETWORK

LAN------FIBER SWITCH-------------SAN STORAGE AREA 10GBPS



CLUSTERING


SERVERA
    ------------> SAN ----------> DATABASE FOR DATA
SERVERB

    SERVERA FAIL : AUTOMATIC SERVERB WILL TAKE OVER
        AND RESUME ALL SERVICES. CUSTOMER SHOULD
        NOT NOTICE!!!    FIX SERVERA AND FAIL BACK
        TO USING SERVERA AGAIN.

        SERVERA 'FAILOVER' TO B
              B  FAILBACK  TO A   WHEN A FIXED



























Virtualization


RUNNING MULTIPLE MACHINES OFF ONE 'HOST' MAIN MACHINE

SNAPSHOT 

    INSTANT BACKUP OF VIRTUAL MACHINE

SANDBOX

    SECURE, CUT-OFF ENVIROMENT WHERE RUN TESTS
    ETC WITHOUT AFFECTING 'REAL WORLD'



Managing Hardware Installations eg Factories, Offices


HVAC Heating, Ventilation, Air Con for all standard
    Buildings

SCADA

    INDUSTRIAL MONITORING OF ALL ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
    EG HVAC, OR MORE ADVANCED EG POWER PLANT, CAR
    FACTORY ETC...




### MOBILE SECURITY


MOBILE SECURITY IS A 'HOT' ISSUE - WHY???

BYOD : BRING OWN DEVICE : PEOPLE USING PERSONAL DEVICES
    TO GET WORK DONE

    SECURITY RISK WITH COMPANY SENSITIVE INFO ON DEVICE
    WHICH IS 

    A) PERSONALLY OWNED
    B) NOT LOCKED DOWN
    C) NO CONTROL OVER OTHER APPS INSTALLED, IF THEY	
        ARE SNOOPING ETC
    

SOLUTION : ???

    ONE SOLUTION IS TO ONLY PERMIT 'REMOTE-DESKTOP' OR
    CITRIX-STYLE ACCESS WHERE PHONE JUST A 'WINDOW' TO
    REMOTE SERVER, NO DATA STORED ON MOBILE DEVICE

REMOTE LOCK

REMOTE WIPE

ON-BOARDING : HIRE EMPLOYEE : GIVE CORRECT TRAINING
                  POLICIES SIGNED

FIND-MY-DEVICE IF LOST

OFF-BOARDING : WIPE DEVICE SECURELY TO ERASE ALL DATA
        (EMPLOYEE LEAVE ORGANISATION)
















### VIRTUALIZATION


RUNNING ONE OR MORE SERVERS FROM A LARGER 'VIRTUAL HOST'

GOOD

    IF YOU ARE LOW ON CPU, RAM, HARD DRIVE OR 
        NETWORK THROUGHPUT THEN YOU CAN 
        DYNAMICALLY UPGRADE THEM AS YOU NEED				
    CREATE 'SANDBOX' ENVIRONMENT FOR SECURE TESTING
    
    CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SERVER OS/BACKUPS ETC
    IN HANDS OF EXPERTS

    NO LONGER REQUIRE PHYSICAL SPACE TO RUN SERVER
        ROOMS ETC

BAD

    TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON INTERNET CONNECTION...

    UNSUITABLE FOR LARGE FILE MANIPULATION EG HUGE
    VIDEOS DOWN LAN WIRE

    COSTLY $$$ JUST TO HOST A SERVER FOR YOU...!!!




















### Site Survey


Used to check
    1) POWER IS NOT TOO GREAT FOR OUR WIFI : SOLUTION : REDUCE
            POWER  (Power in DECIBEL units)

    2) WIFI reaching all necessary parts of our building

HACKER OUTSIDE IN CAR : REDUCE POWER TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM 				OUTSIDE	













### Encryption Methods


These are in increasing order  ((EAP : shell : container))

LEAP		weak		L => LIGHTWEIGHT EAP

PEAP		good		PEAP = PROTECTED EAP
                SERVER : CERTIFICATE
                CLIENT : USER/PASSWORD

EAP-TLS		best		CERTIFICATES : BOTH ON SERVER
                AND CLIENT : ULTRA-SECURE



### Mobile Encryption


ECC Elliptic Curve Cryptography : SMALL, FAST ==> GOOD FOR MOBILE
                    PHONE ENCRYPTION!!!



















### WIFI


Captive Portal : Forces you to read and accept terms and conditions before
connect to free wifi

#### Secure WIFI


1) MAC filtering ==> a LOT OF WORK!!!  (only connect if your MAC 
                        matches)

2) Turn down POWER!

3) ??? not very good ??? ==>  EXAM : OK ANSWER : DISABLE SSID
                    BROADCAST

    SSID ==> Name of WIFI EG FreeHotelWIFI

    POSSIBLE : DISABLE BROADCAST OF SSID
        
        (( PHONE ==> SEE 'UNNAMED NETWORK'))




### WIFI CHANNELS


WIFI HAS 13 CHANNELS

    BUY DEVICE SET TO CHANNEL 1,6, OR 11

        POOR SIGNAL ==> CHANGE CHANNEL













#### War driving / war chalking


WAR CHALKING	: MARKING OUTSIDE FREE WIFI

WAR DRIVING     : LOOKING FOR FREE WIFI



#### WPS WIFI Protected Setup


ONE BUTTON PUSH SETUP : AUTOMATIC 8-DIGIT PIN USED TO CONNECT

    VULERNABILITY : SPLITS INTO TWO 4-DIGIT PINS, EACH ONE
        CAN BE CRACKED EASILY

    EXAM : TURN OFF WPS !!!




















#### Rogue Access Point	

Unauthorised WIFI

#### Evil Twin	

WIFI with SAME NAME AS GOOD WIFI POINT

#### Jamming	

Interference

#### Blue Jack	

Virus over bluetooth / attack (Hi-Jack)

#### Snarf	

Steal

#### Blue Snarf	

Steal data eg contacts over bluetooth

#### Distances

USB		5m



### Broadband Methods

### Dial up


Modem : used to dial up (56k or 92k)



### VPN


PPP	Point-to-point		dial up layer 2

Encryption : 

1)	PPTP					1723			
2)	L2TP/IPSEC				1701
            ((STARSHIP ENTERRIPSE!))
3)	SSTP	VPN OVER HTTPS = SSL = TLS	443
4)	IKEV2					500,4500

L2TP
IKEV
    ==> BOTH USE IPSEC & CERTIFICATES (REALLY SECURE)

SSTP
    ==> USES HTTPS WEB CERTIFICATES (SECURE)

            
### IPSEC

### Virtualization


VM = VIRTUAL MACHINE

.VHD = VIRTUAL HARD DRIVE		WIN7
.VHDX = NEW VHD TYPE			WIN8/10

Hypervisor ==> MINI OPERATING SYSTEM TO RUN VIRTUAL MACHINES
        HYPERV 	WINDOWS Free

SANDBOX ==> VM FOR TESTING EG VIRUSES : TOTALLY ISOLATED

SNAPSHOT ==> INSTANT BACKUP OF YOUR VM SO CAN RESTORE QUICKLY

VHDX = HARD DRIVE

AVHDX = CHANGES SINCE LAST SNAPSHOT!!!





Problems with VMs


Easy to COPY AND STEAL A WHOLE VM!!!

    VM ESCAPE : Lock VM so it only runs on ONE HOST WHICH
            YOU DESIGNED IT FOR!

VM sprawl : easy to create new VMs which can be unpatched / unmanaged

VM escape : Virus from VM can INFECT HOST
































### AV SCANNING 

VIRUS SCAN : BASED ON VIRUS HASH = SIGNATURE


HOW DOES ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE WORK?

    ALL KNOWN VIRUSES ==> TAKE THEIR 'HASH' THEN
    MATCH ANY FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER WHICH HAVE
    THE SAME HASH ==> THEY ARE A VIRUS!!!

    " SIGNATURE-BASED SCANNING "

OR : ANOMALY-BASED

    MATCHING BEHAVIOUR AGAINST A 'BASELINE' PREDICTED
    GRAPH OF ACTIVITY

OR : BEHAVIOUR-BASED 

    MATCHING AGAINST CERTAIN RULES ==> PRONE TO
    'FALSE POSITIVE'  ((GOOD FILE IDENTIFIED 
                INCORRECTLY AS A VIRUS))

















### NETWORK ATTACKS


ROGUE ACCESS POINT

    WIFI POINT (UNAUTHORISED) SET UP IN YOUR 
    VICINITY AND PEOPLE CONNECT TO IT UNAWARES

EVIL TWIN

    WIFI : WIFI ROUTER WITH SAME NAME AS EXISTING 
        ROUTER

        SSID : BROADCAST NAME OF WIFI HOTSPOT

        EVIL TWIN : SAME SSID

    SOCIAL MEDIA : GET FRIEND REQUEST FROM AN 
            EXISTING CONTACT

    
DRIVE-BY-DOWNLOAD

    JUST VIEW SITE : AUTO-DOWNLOAD STARTS IMMEDIATELY

CLICKJACK

    INNOCENT BUTTON EG 'PLAY VIDEO' ALSO START
                MALICIOUS DOWNLOAD

URL SHORTENING SERVICE

    <HTTP://REALLYREYREALLYREALLYREALLYLONGURL.COM>

    ==> TURN INTO BIT.LY/234SDFR.COM		

    BIT.LY
    GOO.GL

        RECOGNISE THAT A HACKER'S SITE COULD
        BE HIDDEN BY 'SHORT' URL

DOS DENIAL OF SERVICE : FLOOD SERVER WITH TRAFFIC

    PING ATTACK : SMURF ATTACK

    SYN FLOOD

        TCP HAS 3-WAY HANDSHAKE TO SET UP 
            CONNECTION : EXPLOIT THIS
            WITH TCP REQUESTS

P2P : PEER-TO-PEER

    CARE !!! COMPUTER IS VULNERABLE WHEN USING
        TORRENT SITES...CLIENT GETS INVADED
        BY OTHER PEOPLE NEEDING COPIES
        OF FILES

ARP POISON

    ARP -A   shows ARP 'CACHE'

        ARP ==> ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

        CONVERTS ....MAC TO IP

DNS POISON

    CORRUPTING DNS DATABASE
    
    EG SERVERA : HACKER RETURN FAKE IP FOR THIS
            SERVER.  PEOPLE WILL GO 
            TO HACKER'S ADDRESS INSTEAD
            OF REAL SERVER

DNS HIJACK : FULL DNS SERVER BUILT AND SET UP BY ATTACKER
    TO POINT PEOPLE TO THE WRONG SITES









### WIRELESS




ROGUE POINT : FAKE WIFI POINT

EVIL TWIN : WIFI POINT WITH SAME NAME

JAMMING : CAUSING INTERFERENCE SO YOU CAN'T DISCERN
        YOUR GOOD SIGNAL

SNARF = STEAL DATA

BLUESNARF = GETTING DATA STOLEN VIA BLUETOOTH

BLUEJACK = PHONE HIJACKED VIA BLUETOOTH EG INSTALL MALWARE
        
NFC NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION : 5cm range

    CARE : SNOOPING IN NEAR VICINITY (RADIO WAVES)

WAR DRIVING

    LOOKING FOR FREE WIFI

WAR CHALKING

    MARKING ON THE PAVEMENT OR WALL WHERE FREE WIFI
        IS TO BE FOUND, SO OTHERS KNOW ALSO

SHORT PASSWORDS - PROBLEM!!

    1) KEY STRETCH 

    2) SALT 

    PASSWORD + SALT PASSWORD ===> MD5 ==> HASH 
            
    mypass  +   Mon: blue   ==>md5         hash
            Tue: red
            ...

            DATABASE : STORE  HASH OF PASSWORD
                     +    SALT

WHAT 4 THINGS DO WE NEED TO CONNECT TO INTERNET???

    1. IP ADDRESS  
    2. SUBNET MASK 255.255.255.0	
    3. GATEWAY     (YOUR OWN PRIVATE ROUTER ON YOUR LAN)
    4. DNS

GATEWAY = COMPUTER ON OUR LAN THROUGH WHICH ALL INTERNET
        TRAFFIC MUST PASS

SINKHOLE ==> IN WIFI, SETTING UP FAKE GATEWAY SO 
    INTERNET TRAFFIC GOING THROUGH BOGUS GATEWAY

        EG HACK INTO DHCP ==> GET DHCP TO GIVE
            OUT A FAKE GATEWAY ADDRESS

WPS : ONE-BUTTON AUTO-SETUP OF HOME WIFI

    VULNERABILITY : 8-DIGIT PIN NUMBER USED TO SET UP

        BUT IT'S SPLIT INTO TWO 4-DIGIT NUMBERS

           4 6 3 7   |   5 8 3 4

        EACH NUMBER CAN BE HACKED SEPARATELY
        (1 IN 10000 SO EASY TO CRACK)



















### ENCRYPTION 


#### S/MIME


ENABLES MAPPING OF CORRECT PROGRAM TO RUN APPLICATIONS 
    INSIDE BROWSER

        EG PDF : GET CORRECT PDF READER

           MP3 : GET CORRECT PLUG-IN TO PLAY FILE	



#### PGP PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY


EMAIL ENCRYPTION



#### HARDWARE ENCYPTION


HSM HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE

    DEDICATED DEVICE : ENCRYPTION ONLY (STORE
        PRIVATE ENCRYPTION KEYS SECURELY)		



#### NTFS ENCRYPTION


USED BY WINDOWS TO ENCRYPT FILES

LIMITED USE!!!

    CANNOT ENCRYPT
            1) WINDOWS

            2) PAGE FILE = SWAP FILE 
                         = VIRTUAL MEMORY

                SPILL-OVER WHEN RAM 
                GETS FULL			

            3) HIBERNATE 
                
                PUTS RAM CONTENTS TO 
                PERMANENT STORAGE
                AND SHUTS PC DOWN



#### BITLOCKER


PROVIDES FULL DRIVE ENCRYPTION, UNLIKE NTFS

PROBLEM!!!  OUR HARD DRIVES BOOT USING MBR MASTER
        BOOT RECORD TALKING TO BIOS/CMOS
        CHIPS ON OUR COMPUTER

        THESE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT UNDERSTAND 			ENCRYPTION!!!

SO TO GET BITLOCKER TO WORK WE MUST SPLIT OUR HARD DRIVE
        IN TWO

|  100MB   |      REST OF DRIVE			|
   PLAIN	  BITLOCKER ENCRYPTED
   TEXT

TPM CHIP  (TRUSTED PLATFORM MODULE)

    DEDICATED CHIP TO STORE BITLOCKER KEYS 

    
    (( IF NO TPM CHIP IS PRESENT, CAN STORE 
        BITLOCKER KEYS ON USB STICK ))



#### SQL DATA


STANDARD DATABASES STORE DATA IN ROWS AND COLUMNS LIKE EXCEL

    TABLE NAME

        ID	FIELD1	FIELD2

        1	JOE	BLOGGS
        2	JOHN	DOE

    CALLED A 'RELATIONAL' DATABASE = MYSQL/SQL
            
        MYSQL = FREE
        SQL   = PAID (MICROSOFT)
        ORACLE = PAID



#### BIG DATA / NO-SQL


TODAY SO MUCH INFORMATION GETS CREATED AND STORED THAT
TRADITIONAL 'RELATIONAL' DATABASES ARE TOO SLOW...

NEW BREED OF DATABASE - NO-SQL OR 'BIG-DATA' STORAGE

FIELDS LOOK LIKE

        {
            "ID" : "1"
            "NAME" : 'PHIL'	
        }

ISSUES WITH SECURITY : DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY : SECURITY,
    ENCRYPTION, PROTECTING DATA



#### DATA DISPOSAL


MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE RESTORED BY CROOKS IF WE DISPOSE
    OF IT CASUALLY.  STRICT POLICIES EXIST TO 
    ENFORCE CORRECT METHOD OF 'DISPOSING' OF DATA

1. WIPE OUR HARD DRIVE WITH RANDOM DATA 7 TIMES OVER

    (( THINK MUDDY FIELD : DRIVE 100 CARS ROUND 
        FIELD 10 MINUTES : ERASE ORIGINAL 
        TRACKS ))

2. DEGAUSS : TAKE A MAGNET AND WIPE DRIVE

3. PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION EG HAMMER OR PHYSICALLY SHRED DRIVE



#### HARDENING YOUR SERVER


HARDEN SERVER = INCREASE SECURITY

BASELINE = ORIGINAL SETTINGS

    HARDEN ==> CREATE NEW BASELINE FOR HARDENED SERVER

GET BASICS RIGHT

    UPDATES FOR SERVER : ON
    UPDATES FOR AV SOFTWARE : ON
    UPDATES FOR APPLICATIONS : PATCH MANAGEMENT : ON



#### INPUT VALIDATION


STOP 'COMMAND INJECTION' ATTACK   

    FORM  ==>   INJECT CODE EG <script>....code </script>

ERROR / EXCEPTION

    COMPUTER CRASHES : REVEAL SENSITIVE INFO EG
     FILE NAMES AND PATHS ON ROOT SERVER

        ERROR: //c:\\windows\\system32\\thisfile.dll...
             c:\\....to website....

    PROGRAMMER HAS TO 'HANDLE' EXCEPTIONS/ERRORS PROPERLY
        WITHOUT GIVING HACKERS EXTRA INFO

XSS : TRYING TO HACK FROM YOUR SITE TO NEIGHBOURING SITE
    (CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING)

XSRF : LOGGED IN ALREADY SO POSSIBLE POTENTIAL TO HACK 
        GREATER 



### Types of testing


BLACK BOX TESTING : JUST LOOK AT INPUT / OUTPUT ONLY
        (NOT DETAILS OF INSIDE CODING)

WHITE BOX TESTING  : KNOWING CODE INSIDE, TRYING TO 						TO BREAK IT DELIBERATELY

UNIT TESTING : ONE SMALL BLOCK OF CODE

INTEGRATION/SYSTEM TESTING : TESTING THE BIG PICTURE

ALPHA TEST : INITIAL RELEASE TO CHOSEN INDIVIDUALS FOR TESTING
    EG JOURNALISTS, DEDICATED AUDIENCE

BETA TEST : FINAL RELEASE, FREE, SO PEOPLE CAN TEST IT FOR 
        YOU (THEY GET FREE GAME!) 

FUZZ TEST : THROW RANDOM DATA AT APPLICATION : DOES IT
        WITHSTAND AND SURVIVE ???


Black Box		Input/Output ONLY!

White Box		Know code : test to break code of program!

Grey Box		Some knowledge

Alpha 			FIRST EARLY RELEASE

Beta			NEAR TO PERFECT : GIVE AWAY FOR FREE: 
            IRON OUT ALL THE BUGS

Unit			Small piece of code !  Test that only

Integration		Join UNITS together

System			Build final product and test

Regression		Fix bugs BUT RE-TEST PRODUCT SO NEW ERRORS
            ARE NOT INTRODUCED

Fuzz Testing		THROWING RANDOM DATA AT OUR APPLICATION
            TO SEE IF IT CATCHES ALL ERRORS, EVEN
            FROM RANDOM RUBBISH

Validation Testing - high level overview - has original purpose of software been achieved

Verification Testing - have the design specs been met





#### PROXY SERVER


USED IN BIG COMPANIES FOR MANY REASONS : 

1) SECURITY : USING DIFFERENT IP THAN REAL GATEWAY

2) CACHING : SPEED OF DATA : STORE COPIES OF FILES ETC
            ON LOCAL LAN PROXY SERVER. 
            CLIENTS GET FASTER ACCESS

3) FILTERING : WHITELIST (GOOD SITES) /BLACKLIST (BLOCKED
            SITES)

4) USER ACTIVITY : KNOW WHICH USERS ONLINE, HOW LONG, WHICH
            SITES...BILLING PURPOSES...



#### TCP TRUSTED COMPUTING BASE


OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE 'HARDENED' OR LOCKED DOWN




#### UTM UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT

BIG PICTURE OF PROTECTING OUR WHOLE NETWORK


















### NETWORKS

HUB		LAYER 1		ELECTRICITY IN, 
                ELECTRICITY OUT (NO
                FILTERING)  
                BAD ==> BROADCASTS!!!!

REPEATER	LAYER 1		EXTEND ETHERNET 100M TO 
                200M OR MORE			
                (( 2-PORT HUB ))


LOAD BALANCER	DOING 'ROUND ROBIN' TO ENABLE MULTIPLE
            SERVERS TO HANDLE MANY REQUESTS

IDS INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM 	: JOB IS TO DETECT
        HACKING ACTIVITY / VIRUS ACTIVITY			

HOST = MACHINE EG SERVER/CLIENT USUALLY 'HOSTING' A
        SERVICE

NODE = ANY DEVICE WHATSOEVER ON OUR NETWORK : IP PHONE,
        ROUTER, FIREWALL...

HIDS = HOST-BASED DETECTION : SOFTWARE ON ONE MACHINE ONLY

NIDS = NETWORK-BASED DETECTION EG ON FIREWALL / GATEWAY
        PROTECTING WHOLE NETWORK

IPS INTRUSION PREVENTION : ABILITY TO DETECT ATTACK BUT ALSO
    TAKE MEASURES TO STOP AN ATTACK...

    HIPS HOST-BASED
    NIPS NETWORK-BASED






### ANTI VIRUS SCANNING 

#### SIGNATURE BASED SCANNING

    FIXED SCANNING TO MATCH 'HASH' OF KNOWN VIRUSES
        (BEST AS GIVES RELIABLE DETECTION)

#### ANOMALY BASED SCANNING 

    LOOKING AT 'BASELINE' GRAPHS OF PREDICTED
    TRAFFIC PATTERNS AGAINST ACTUAL TRAFFIC 
    PATTERNS OVER A NETWORK

#### BEHAVIOUR BASED SCANNING

    PATTERNS IN NETWORK TRAFFIC OR 'RULES' GOVERNING
    EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR : ALERTS IF TRAFFIC BREAKS
    SOME 'EXPECTED RULES'

        ** PRONE TO FALSE POSITIVE **

        FALSE POSITIVE = TAKING A GOOD FILE AND
                MARKING IT AS A VIRUS

#### HEURISTIC SCANNING = REAL-TIME SCANNING



### VPN : VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK


ENCRYPT DATA TRAFFIC IN A 'TUNNEL' ACROSS INTERNET



VPN Concentrator : Allow multiple VPN connections into ONE SERVER

Web Security Gateway = Layer 7 firewall looking at content
of traffic coming into your network


    ==> Deep packet inspection

BIG PICTURE ==> UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT (UTM)



NAC : NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL : PROTECTS OUR NETWORK FROM ...
COMPUTERS DIALING IN WHICH MAYBE HAVE VIRUSES ETC


        ==> CHECK HEALTH AND FORCE NON-COMPLIANT
            COMPUTERS TO COMPLY










# Security Architecture 

## Zones

Network segments with traffic between zones controlled eg with a firewall enforcing ACL rules

## Bastion Host = DMZ 

external internet-facing servers

       often configured as proxies, talking to services inside the LAN
       
### Jump Box

single machine on DMZ from which the admin consoles on the bastion hosts may be reached. Access to the Jump Box is tightly controlled eg by single firewall rule to single IP or small subnet on LAN

Management machines (on the LAN) which connect to the jump box should be denied broad internet access

Blackhole Redirect unused ports to specific part of network that is a dead end


       create VLAN or
       redirect traffic to NULL router interface


DOS attack : normally use ACL but instead can just put all traffic to a blackhole

Sinkhole

Instead of blackhole : deleting all packets

Sinkhole is alternative gateway through which all the traffic redirected can also be analysed


       Goal is to find out source of attack and neutralise it
       
       Martian packet = packet destined for IANA Private or restricted range

       Bogon = unallocated range on the internet (there are none left)
       
       
       


## Hardening

Host Baseline = minimum secure config

Attack surface = what can be attacked


       Interfaces - wired and wireless
       Services
       Ports
       


### Baselining

Baselining checklist

Remove all non-necessary devices
Install OS updates and patches, and application updates etc
Note : test updates etc offline first then use distributed system to update clients
Uninstall all unnecessary network protocols
Uninstall/disable services
Remove / disable unnecessary shares
ACL on all resources
Least Privilege user accounts especially with regards to installing software
Rename local admin and apply strong password
Disable guest accounts
Disable default group accounts
remove everyone group permissions from resources
Install and update AV. Autoscan USB&Email&Downloads
Routers and Switches: Update OS, Firmware, ROMMON = OS in NVRAM

DOS attacks - consider possibility and mitigate or provide backup resources

#### Group Policies

Admin Templates - registry

RSoP - settings can be viewed
       
Security Templates
      
DAC - discretionary NTFS ACL

MAC - mandatory CLASSIFIED ETC - Need to know basis

       Subject can't set or change the MAC level
       
## Endpoint security

       Endpoint = client device
       
       Perimeter security = gateway/firewall/dmz etc (opposite of endpoint)
       

### Port security : restrict access


       disable using management software
       
       MAC filter : hard in practice
       
       MAC limiting : only will register first two MAC addresses then drop the others
       
       MAC flooding : switch could 'fail-open' and become like a hub 
              so attacker easier to sniff
              
       802.1x port based control  (port based NAC = PNAC)
       
              supplicant = client device requesting access
              
              switch = authenticator
              
                      EAPoL EAP over LAN requires password, token or certificate
                      
                      Pass to RADIUS server for authentication
                      
              unauthenticated hosts => go to guest VLAN
              


Extra

Is intrusion primary or secondary

Avoid alter attacker

Preserve evidence















































#  Identities 


## NAC

Health policy : firewall, updates etc

Agent on client

Remediation to bring to good health


       refuse or
       quarantine (if VPN) or
       captive portal (if web app) and from there install fixes
       


Pre-admission Post-admission - is it still compliant?

### NAC Policy


       Time restrictions
       Location restrictions
       Role-based restrictions (user and device)
       Rule-based restrictions
       
       Microsoft NAC
       Cisco CNAC
       TPM NAC 
       
       Context-based authentication 
              Time
              Location
              Frequency : number of logins during a given period
              Rule-based : can have multiple factors involved
       


#### Types of rules


       Anti-Malware
              Signature based = HASH
              Behaviour Based = Deviation from baseline eg high CPU/RAM, high traffic with DOS attack
              Anomaly Based = Patterns beyond the normal eg check packet headers for anything unusual, or traffic patterns
              Heuristic = real time scanning, looking for certain patterns in malware code
       NAC
              Time based
              Location based
              Role based
       


## Identity

enrol = sign up

provision - create new account

captcha - verify genuine user signing up

identity proof for user at sign up

privileged accounts

shared accounts - don't know who did what

rbac role based access control - by job role


### identity by ...

IP address
MAC address
Host name
Machine certificate
App certificate





### nac 

complicance

- wifi
- wired
- protocol
- host
- ip
- ports
- apps








## certificates

### sigcheck verify root certificate valid

tool from sysinternals

```bash
sigcheck -tv 
```

### openssl

### certutil (windows)






## dial in

### RADIUS


       Radius server performs authentication (AD)
       
       Client - 802.1x - wifi or other - RADIUS - AD LDAP AUTHENTCATION BACKEND

       windows NPS
       
       linux FreeRADIUS
       
       uses UDP
       
       encrypts ONLY PASSWORD
       
       
       


### TACACS+


       uses TCP
       
       ENCRYPTS ALL DATA - so more secure than RADIUS


### LDAP (Active Directory)


       LDAP 389 


Defences multiple logon attempts geo-velocity - trying to logon from different placess geographically device fingerprinting - is this the first time this device has been used? if so, use two-factor authentication

### SSO

Federation

open to business partners

provisioning = creating accounts for use with federation


       manual
       auto eg by group membership
       


#### SAML : token-based SSO (security assertion markup language)


       SAML is enterprise controlled


#### OpenID


       sign on with .. google, facebook account etc

       user-centric logon
       
       no sharing of data from eg google to the company using this login
       
       OpenID Connect uses OpenAuth also
       Facebook connect ...
       


#### OpenAuth (Open Authorization)


       site providing sharing of data with site being authenticated
       


Password reset

1. questions
2. secondary verification eg text or email



























## Hacking attempts

Impersonation : pretending to be somebody else.
Use ‘identity proofing’ to mitigate = be sure to identify someone properly online

DNS Spoof pharming = DNS Spoof

Session hijack : mitigate with encryption of session

Replay attack

MITM

MItB

ARP Spoof

       Ettercap lab
       
       DAI Dynamic ARP Inspection : prevent ARP Spoof : drop Ethernet packets that do not have a known sender, recipient and a valid entry in VLAN table


Privilege escalation


       Using FLAW IN APPLICATION TO GAIN ACCESS

       Backdoor = deliberate

       Vertical : go from user to admin rights
       Horizontal : go from one user and gain access as another user


Web hacking

SSLstrip


       tricks user into thinking connection is secure when it's not
       
       Padlock is not showing so user can spot this and know they are
                      being hacked
                      
       HTST can prevent this attack : HTTPS is the ONLY TRANSPORT ALLOWED
                      TO THAT SITE SO HTTP IS NOT AN OPTION, SO AN ATTACKER CANNOT
                      FAKE AN HTTP SESSION
                      


XSS Cross Site Scripting


       Malicious code runs on client browser with same permission level
              as a trusted site
              
       reflected = non-persistent attack : once
       
       stored = persistent attack eg malicious script stored in a blog 
              or user forum
              
       XSS is script from server executed on client
       
              eg GET /cgi-bin/log.cgi?<script>...</script>
       
       Or
       
       could execute a script to create a new DOM page 

       Mitigate with INPUT VALIDATION
       


XSRF : like XSS cross-site scripting but have additional power due to virtue of also being logged in (authenticated to site)


       mitigate by mutual authentication on both sides of the connection
       
       


Cookies


       Retain information about STATE
       
       Cookies are sent WITH THE HTTP REQUEST FROM CLIENT TO SERVER AND BACK
       
       NON-PERSISTENT = SESSION
       
       PERSISTENT
       
       XSS ATTEMPTS TO USE COOKIE ON ANOTHER SITE
       
       SSL COOKIES ARE TRANSMITTED ENCRYPTED BUT STORED PLAIN TEXT


       


XSRF EXPLOIT COOKIES


       can exploit applications which use cookies to authenticate and
              track sessions























CIDR /24 MEANS


REMOTE ACCES


ALLOWING COMPUTER TO DIAL IN TO OUR SERVER (RAS = REMOTE
ACCESS SERVER)

    ADD ROLE ==> ROUTING & REMOTE ACCESS

CLIENT => DIAL IN => RAS SERVER
             (VPN SERVER)

            ==> AUTHENTIATE WITH RADIUS SERVER
                (TALK TO ACTIVE DIRECTORY)

            ==> HEALTH CHECK VIA NAC NETWORK
                ACCESS CONTROL



















## Threat Detection


1. Signature Based

    EVERY BAD VIRUS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT : TAKE IT'S HASH!!!

    SCAN OUR COMPUTER ETC FOR ALL GOOD FILES : IF ANY MATCH
    HASH OF A VIRUS ==> WE ALERT!!!!

2. Anomaly Based 

    'Baseline' graph of GOOD BEHAVIOUR EG CPU, RAM, NETWORK

    ==> VIRUS : OFTEN SHOW AS INCREASED CPU ETC : Trigger
                    an alert

        ==> ANOMALY CHECKS AGAINST A GOOD BASELINE GRAPH!!

3. Behaviour Based  ** NOT SO RELIABLE (FALSE POSITIVES!!)

    Creates RULES : if a virus triggers a rule we get an 
            alert eg a certain process running on 
            our PC

    HEURISTIC = REAL TIME SCANNING   (SLOW PC!)




Detecting attacks


Honeypot  : FAKE LURE : 1) We can get info on them!
            2) They are wasting their time!!!

Honeynet

### Network Attacks And Security


Zero day ==> ATTACK ON BRAND NEW SOFTWARE : BAD GUYS FIND VULNERABILITY
AND EXPLOIT IT BEFORE GOOD GUYS GET TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING

Hardening Your System


Harden = make more secure

    Disable unused services and ports
    Security baseline = preconfigured settings to make your
        machine secure
    MBSA Microsoft Baseline Security Analysis : lets you 
        know if your system is weak!!!

    Attack Surface : what enemy can see / use /exploit to 
        attack us eg SERVICES, APPLICATIONS ==> CAN
        BE HACKED!   TURN OFF IF NOT BEING USED!

    Disable unused accounts

Baseline ==> STARTING POINT, KNOWN SETTINGS, PREDICTABLE GRAPH

    Task Manager			BASIC		TASKMGR
    Resource Monitor		BETTER		RESMON
    Performance Monitor		MOST ADVANCED	PERFMON
        OUTPUT TO FILE : DCS DATA COLLECTOR SET
            ANALYSIS LATER

Group Policy ==> CONTROL ENTIRE COMPANY

    Password policy
    Lockout policy
    Audit policy ==> CHECK LOGS
    AppLocker ==> BLOCK SOFTWARE FROM RUNNING
    
Images
    BUILD SECURE PC/SERVER THEN PUSH OUT TO ENTIRE COMPANY!
        (GOLD STANDARD MASTER IMAGE)

Host Baseline
    OS
    Application		
    
Trusted OS ==> can LOCK DOWN AND MAKE SURE!!!

    TCB Trusted Computing Base : secure OS eg LINUX



























### Code Injection Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection

Code injection

Man In The Middle






















### Forensics



Forensics : Science of criminology : examining a PC as part of
        a crime scene

    DATA VOLATILITY

        VOLATILE DATA IS DATA IN RAM/CACHE WHICH WILL
            DISAPPEAR WHEN TURN PC OFF!!!

        ORDER OF VOLATILITY

            CPU
            RAM
            CACHE (TEMP)
            HARD DRIVE 
            LONG TERM BACKUP

    CHAIN OF CUSTODY
        
        GET PC ==> FIRST IMAGE IT!!!  
        HASH/SIGN IMAGE (MUST HAVE DATE STAMP ALSO)
                (( AWARE OF TIME ZONE))

        CHAIN OF CUSTODY : SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE 
            RESPONSIBLE FOR EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES

On board/off board
    ON BOARD ==> HIRE, NEW EMPLOYEE
    OFF BOARD ==> EXIT ORGANISATION





















TPM : CHIP TO STORE BITLOCKER KEYS

HSM : HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE : CAN STORE ANY KEYS FOR YOUR
        COMPANY (STAND-ALONE DEVICE)

​		

DLP = data loss prevention











































## Network Scanning 
   
               
ATTACK SURFACE ==> SOMETHING IN WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED TO a4 THREAT

HONEYPOT

    DECOY TO DISTRACT ATTACKER 1) THEY ARE DISTRACTED
                   2) WE CAN PERHAPS MONITOR
                      THEM
HONEYNET

    WHOLE NETWORK OF DISTRACTION


### Scanning for vulnerabilities

Enemy may do the following : 

    Footprinting : use common sense methods to try and
            gain info on you.  Using methods
            which may be legal eg public 
            birth/death/marriage records, 
            public accounts records, website info

    Enumerating : Using illegal methods to gain further
              detailed info about you.

              EG  COMPANY : DOING PORT SCANS, 
               HACKING IN AND GETTING NETWORK INFO,
               IP INFO, PORT INFO, SERVER NAME 
               INFO, NAMES OF KEY PEOPLE WHO
    
            Personal level : credit card info,
                security answers to questions

You may do the following

    Vulnerability Scan

    Port scan

    Deep-level test to try and penetrate your network
            eg using ethical hackers etc






### DLP


TWO MEANINGS

    DATA LOSS PREVENTION : DATA TAKEN (STOLEN AND REMOVED)

    DATA LEAK PREVENTION : COPY TAKEN 



FAILSAFE : Industrial chain saw will not work unless thumb and fingers
pressing on two separate buttons

FAILSECURE


POWER GOES OUT : SECURE LOCKED DOOR : REMAIN LOCKED BUT
    IF PERSON TRAPPED INSIDE THEY STILL CAN FORCE
    THE DOOR OPEN AND GET OPEN

    EG SERVER ROOM / SAFE



FAILOPEN


POWER GOES OUT : DOOR SWING WIDE OPEN



RESPONDING TO SECURITY INCIDENTS


IRP : INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY

    EG PEOPLE TO CONTACT STRAIGHT AWAY
       ACTIONS TO TAKE EG UNPLUG FROM NETWORK
       DESIGNATED PEOPLE TO BE 'IN CHARGE' IN CASE
        OF UNCERTAINTY
       FIRST RESPONDER : EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM



FIGHTING CRIME : FORENSICS


IT IS IMPORTANT IN A COURT OF LAW THAT EVIDENCE IS 
    ADMISSIBLE.  IF NOT, IT CANNOT BE USED
    AGAINST A DEFENDANT	

INVESTIGATING A CRIME

    1. LOOK AT ANYTHING 'VOLATILE'  <<VOLATILITY>>

        TURN OFF ==> INFO DISAPPEARS

        EG  CONTENTS OF RAM OR PAGE FILES ETC

    2. HARD DRIVE : TAKE IMAGE STRAIGHT AWAY

        SIGN/HASH IMAGE 

    3. CREATE A 'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'

        SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR
        EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES



DISASTER RECOVERY


FAULT TOLERANCE = RECOVERY FROM FAULT

    EG RAID 5  :   DRIVE FAILS ==> STILL SURVIVE
       CLUSTER :   SERVER FAILS ==> GO TO SERVERB

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE = ONE THING WHICH, IF IT BREAKS, 
        MAKES YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM FAIL (EG YOUR BRAIN!)

    ROUTER : GATEWAY : TO INTERNET
    SWITCH : CENTRAL POINT OF NETWORK

BCP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN : WRITTEN PLAN FOR ACTIVITY
        IN CERTAIN EVENTS EG WEBSITE GETS HACKED.

BIA BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS : WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THREAT
        X MATERIALIZES (IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS)

MTD MAX TOLERABLE DOWNTIME

    EG IF SERVER GOES DOWN, IT MUST BE UP WITHIN 2 DAYS	

RPO : RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

    HOW FREQUENT ARE YOUR BACKUPS???
    IF DISASTER, HOW MUCH DATA ARE YOUR PREPARED TO LOSE?
    EG EVERY 4 HOURS YOU BACKUP, THEN POTENTIALLY
    ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE 4 HOURS WORTH OF DATA?

RTO RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE : PLANNED TIME BY WHICH WE 
    HAVE FIXED AN ITEM AND GET EVERYTHING WORKING



HOT/WARM/COLD SITE


HOT SITE : 100% READY TO GO - COMPUTERS, NETWORK

        *** TOO COSTLY ! ***

WARM SITE : PCS THERE, SHUT DOWN.  1-2 DAYS TO GET SET 
    UP, RESTORE BACKUPS, BEGIN WORK.

        *** HIGH BUT REASONABLE COST **

COLD SITE : JUST BARE SHELL OF BUILDING WITH WATER AND
        ELECTRICITY AND LITTLE ELSE

    1-2 WEEKS TO SET UP



MTTF MEAN TIME TO FAIL = AVERAGE TIME BEFORE EG HARD DRIVE FAIL (3 YEARS)


==> MTBF MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES



MTTR MEAN TIME TO REPAIR : AVERAGE TIME TO FIX EG SERVER

Server

1. RENAME
FIX SERVER IP
2. DCPROMO : BUILD DOMAIN phil.local (COMPANY)
3. DNS ON CLIENT : POINT TO SERVER IP
4. JOIN CLIENT TO DOMAIN









































### Advanced Malware Attacks

Ping flood	Flooding a server with PING REQUESTS
ICMP flood
PING = ICMP

Smurf Attack	Malformed PING : DISGUISE SOURCE IP

TCP SYN Flood
TCP : Always send a '3-WAY HANDSHAKE' to set up
1) Hello : I'm going to send you data 2) Server : OK 3) Client : Done


SYN FLOOD : Send lots of 'hello' (stage 1) requests ONLY
    Server : reserve space for conversations which never happen



Flood guard : watches for and prevents flood attacks (DOS flood)

Port Scan	Scanning network for all OPEN PORTS (free online port scan)	*** NOTE : THIS IS SEEN AS AN ATTACK **

XMAS Attack	Port Scan ==> ALL OF THE POSSIBLE 'FLAGS' SET TO 'HIGH' (1)
TO PROVOKE A RESPONSE

MITM Man In The Middle


Client			Bad Router 		Server

        Can be used 
        1) Eavesdrop : LISTEN (Passive)
        2) Alter packets in some way
                (Active)

Prevent : HTTPS Scanning (part of UTM Threat Management)



Session Hijack


Client---------------Bad Router----------------Server

    Bad router can actually 'take over' session

             Bad Router----------------Server

    Server THINKS STILL TALKING TO CLIENT BUT IS NOT: 
        BAD ROUTER IS IMPERSONATING AND HAS TAKEN
        OVER THE SESSION



Session Replay Attack


Valid session is copied and played back later

Client---------------Bad Router---------------Server

    later on Bad Router 'replay' same packets back to server
    to create a 'dummy' connection.

Mitigate using TIMESTAMPS



Passord Attack

​    STOP : using Account Lockout Policy

Birthday attack
TWO FILES CAN HAVE SAME HASH : USE THIS TO GET PAST OUR 'HASHING'	PROOF THAT A FILE HAS NOT CHANGED



DNS Map NAME to IP

DNS Poison : FAKE DNS Records

DNS Pharming attack : FAKE DNS SERVER or CORRUPT 'HOSTS' RECORD ON ONE PC
Hosts ==> NOT USED NOW!!!
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

ARP	Address Resolution Protocol	IP to MAC conversion
arp -a

ARP Poison
Fake/change some ARP data to cause trouble

Typo Squatting


    Gooogle.com
    Amazone.com     MIS-SPELLING OF COMMON SITES : PEOPLE BUY
            DOMAIN NAME THEN SELL TO CORRECT OWNER FOR
            LOTS OF MONEY



URL Hijacking
Buy domain names of companies and 'sit on them'. Force
legitimate company to pay us lots of money to sell them
back their own domain name

Watering Hole	Attacks on sites which are very popular and lots of people
hanging around eg social media sites

Zero Day	Brand new software : Hackers discover weakness : exploit it
before good guys get a fix

Cookie	Text file : tracking your browsing

LSO Flash Cookie DON'T USE FLASH ! But in the exam!!!
Flash Cookie = LSO Locally Shared Object

Errors	Programmer error ==> get wrong answer!!! (eg Interest Rate
is wrong)

Exceptions	SYSTEM CRASH!!!!
Handled : sorted internally
Unhandled : PROGRAM CRASHES!!

Application Attack
Main APPLICATIONS we are concerned with are
1) HTTP/HTTPS WEB SERVER!!!
LINUX : FREE 'APACHE' WEBSITE
WINDOWS : FREE : IIS INTERNET INFORMATION
SERVICES
2) DATABASE SERVER
3) EXCHANGE EMAIL ETC

Injection Attacks


Website : FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION
      eg
        name..........  dob........  
        address.........

                SUBMIT

It's possible to INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING TEXT, SUBMIT CODE INSTEAD!!!
    
SQL
    REGULAR SQL : SELECT * FROM USERS ...

    FORM : Instead of submitting name, submit SQL code instead.
    
LDAP	
XML



Input Validation


Check for 'strange' characters like \\ / < > ' "   etc in fields



Buffer Overflow Attack


Buffer 
    Temporary data store to hold information when network
    is slow : waiting for data to either send or receive

    Buffer data is stored in RAM of COMPUTER!

    Buffer Overflow attack ==> PUSH GOOD DATA OUT OF BUFFER,
        POSSIBLY GET ACCESS TO AREAS OF RAM NEXT TO 
        THE BUFFER WHICH NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO



XSS Cross Site Scripting


Hack in to one website and from there, hack into another	



Folder Traversal Attack


Reach one folder : from there, navigate and reach another folder



XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery


Hack a website but ALREADY LOGGED IN ==> YOU HAVE MORE POWER
    TO DO MORE DAMAGE WHEN YOU HACK IN





#### CODE INJECTION ATTACK = APPLICATION ATTACK


CODE INJECTION ATTACK : CAN PUT <script>....code..</script>

    INTO A WEB FORM WHERE REGULAR TEXT IS EXPECTED

### XSS CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

    INJECTED CODE ATTEMPTS TO AFFECT OTHER SITES
    WHICH MAY BE 'HOSTED' ON SAME WEB SERVER


#### XSRF CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

    USER IS LOGGED IN ALREADY SO THIS CODE INJECTION
    PERHAPS HAS GREATER PERMISSIONS TO DO DAMAGE



    HOT FIX		SHORT-TERM FIX TO ISSUE	
    PATCH		FIX TO A FAULT
    UPDATE		IMPROVEMENT
    SERVICE PACK	CUMULATIVE PREVIOUS UPDATES IN ONE

#### BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK

    RAM (MEMORY) 
    
        SECURE RAM   |   BUFFER = SHORT TERM STORAGE
                 |		 AREA EG FOR HARD 
                         DRIVE
    
    BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK TRIES TO PUT SO MUCH DATA
        IN BUFFER, ATTACKING CODE REACHES SECURE
        AREA OF RAM

#### INJECTION TYPES
        SQL (DATABASE)
        XML (TEXT DATABASE)
        LDAP (ACTIVE DIRECTORY)



PORT


1.2.3.4 : 80

IP      : PORT

<--socket----->  		SOCKET = IP:PORT

WHAT IS A PORT???

    IT IS A CHANNEL BY WHICH DATA GETS SENT TO IP
        ADDRESS
    
        PICTURE : YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE OF 65000
            MAILBOXES IN ORDER TO GET 
            YOUR MAIL THROUGH!!!
    
        NOTE : HTTP ALWAYS PORT 80, HTTPS ALWAYS 443
    
    PORT 1-1000 ARE PRE-RESERVED FOR INTERNET USE
         1000+ CAN BE CONFIGURED BY USER
            EG GAMERS : SET PORT FORWARDING
                ON YOUR ROUTER SO GAMING
                TRAFFIC REACHES EG XBOX
    
    65536 VALID PORTS


​	
PORT SCAN

    *** POSSIBLY COULD BE SEEN AS A HACKING TOOL **
    
    USED TO SCAN ALL PORTS ON IP ADDRESS TO SEE WHICH
    ONES ARE OPEN, OFTEN WITH A VIEW TO THEN HACKING
    INTO THAT ORGANISATION
    
    <http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx>
    
        EG cfa.org

XMAS DAY ATTACK

    DOING A PORT SCAN WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE FLAGS				SET TO 'ON' TO TRY AND TRIGGER A RESPONSE FROM
    EACH PORT


#### EAVESDROPPING

LISTENING IN TO TRAFFIC OR SIGNALS

    WIRESHARK OR NETMON

#### MAN-IN-MIDDLE ATTACK

    client -----------router-----------------server
    
            ROUTER OWNED
            BY HACKER : 
            CAPTURING AND
            VIEWING TRAFFIC	
            [[ POSSIBLY COULD
            TRY TO MODIFY
            TRAFFIC ALSO]]

#### SESSION HIJACKING

    client --------------router-----------------server
    
        ROUTER IN MIDDLE TOTALLY TAKES OVER
        THE SESSION, PRETENDING TO BE ONE
        OF THE MACHINES
    
    client---------------router
    
        SESSION HIJACKED - CLIENT THINKS IT IS 		
        TALKING TO SERVER BUT IS NOT!

#### SESSION REPLAY

    9AM:
    
    client ------------router -----------------server
