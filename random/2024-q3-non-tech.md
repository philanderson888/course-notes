### Spaceflight - Manned By Date

```
1957? Gargarin first human in space
1961 Alan Shepherd first US in space
? First space walk Alexei Leonov - had to decompress suit to get back into capsule
1965 Gemini 4 first US space walk Ed White
? Gemini 8 - moon race - first docking of spacecraft
1969 Apollo 12 was second manned trip to moon
? Apollo 13 
1973 Skylab was the first US Space Station occupied for 24 weeks.
1976 Soyuz 23 - men landed in lake overnight but rescued in the morning 
? Salyut 5 orbiting space station (military) - docking fails so forced re-entry
1984? Challenger blew up
1998 ISS International Space Station .... orbit 92 minutes
2000 ISS has been occupied since this date ... 
```


### Spaceflight - Unmanned By Date

```
1957 Sputnik 1 - First Ever
? Lunik 5 - photographed far side of moon
Late 1970s Voyager I deep space probe 
Late 1970s Voyager II deep space probe 
? Voyager to Mars (not related to voyager deep space probe)
1975 Viking I to Mars
1976 Viking II to Mars reached the surface


DART crash into asteroid to divert it (Double Asteroid Redirection Test)

? Mars Rover got stuck


? Mars Opportunity still going 2023


? Mars Curiosity planned use is 2 years powered by Plutonium
? Mars Perseverance


Surveyor probes to the moon
Surveyor III took a soil sampling probe to the moon and was later brought back to earth


2007 - Dawn Probe to the outer solar system     
2015 Dawn flies past Ceres in the Asteroid belt  ....   Shiny white areas are observed. ... Is it ice? The whole planet is ice so what are the patches?   ...  Or are they salts? This would indicate liquid created the conditions to lay down the salt crystals!

## asteroid

### 2023

osiris-rex to asteroid bennu and returned with samples to earth

### 2016
