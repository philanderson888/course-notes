# history of the earth

2.7 billion years ago plants made oxygen using the sun ... planet was transformed

2.7 billion years ago the oxygen reduced much of the earths insulating gases ... and so the temperature of the earth dropped and a series of ice ages began

## ways to go back in time

- ice samples can go back in time ... trapped particles of air inside the snow ice can be analysed
- geological rocks - igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic
  - some rocks lay down annual bands eg where we had an annual cycle of heat,evaporation etc
  - coal is trapped organic matter so can be used to look back in time
  - animals can be fossilised inside rocks and can be viewed
- doppler red shift for items across the galaxy
- tree rings

## history - israel

The land of Israel has been populated by the Jewish people since 2000 BC. Here's the timeline, in case you didn't realize that it is their homeland, as designated by Lord Jesus Christ.

1900 BC: Abraham chosen by God as the Father of the Jewish Nation.

1900 BC: Isaac, Abraham's son, rules over Israel.

1850 BC: Jacob, son of Issac, rules over Israel.

1400 BC: Moses leads the people out of Egypt and back to Israel.

1010 BC: King David unites the 12 tribes into one nation.

970 BC: King Solomon, son of David, builds the first temple structure in Jerusalem

930 BC: Israel is divided into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.

800s BC: The rise of the prophets, God's messengers.

722 BC: Kingdom of Israel is conquered by Assyrians.

605 BC: Kingdom Judah is conquered by the Babylonians.

586 BC: Solomon's Temple is destroyed by the Babylonians.

539 BC: Persians conquer the Babylonians and take control of Israel.

538 BC: The Jews return to Israel from exile.

520 BC: The Temple is rebuilt.

450 BC: Reforms made by Ezra and Nehemiah.

433 BC: Malachi is the end of the prophetic age.

432 BC: The last group of Jews return from exile.

333 BC: The Greeks conquer the Persian empire.

323 BC: The Egyptian and Syrian empire take over Israel.

167 BC: Hasmonean's recapture Israel, and the Jews are ruled independently.

70 BC: Romans conquer Israel.

20 BC: King Herod builds the "second" temple

6 BC: Jesus Christ is born in Bethlehem

70 AD: Romans destroy the temple

After that, the people were captives to the Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, and Crusaders. Through all of these events, the Jewish people continued to live in Israel. There were more or less of them, depending on the centuries, but there was never a time when the Jews didn't live in the land. They stayed, they built their communities, they raised their families, practiced their faith and they suffered at the hands of many outside rulers, but they always kept their faith. It is what sustains them, even now.

In 1948, the UN established the State of Israel, the nation of Jews. Don't buy the Palestinian lies that they are entitled to the land. It simply is not true. God will also provide a way for his chosen people to live in Israel, as He has for thousands of years. 

Pray for the people of Israel.

# glossary - javascript


## ASCII

Represent ASCII literal as "\u0041"


## BigInt

Can hold arbitrarily large integer numbers
[https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint)

## Console Output

```js
javascript:console.log('hi'); // FROM THE BROWSER WINDOW!!! OR URL LINK!!!
console.log() produces black text
[console.info](http://console.info/)() blue text with icon
console.debug() blu
console.warn() yellow with icon
console.error() red with icon
console.table(); tabular output for a JSON object
var x=1; console.log("output %d",x); %d=integer, %s=string, %o=object
console.log('this object is is %o ',this);
console.log('this event is %o ',event);
console.log("%s",new Error().stack);
console.dir(object-goes-here);
console.dirxml(HTML DOM NODE);
console.important()
console.todo()
console.trace() view stack
console.time('x'); start a stopwatch
console.endTime('x') end stopwatch
Debug : Break on HTML change
Monitor('function1');
Debug('functionname');
Toggle device mode chrome
```
## const

```js
const variables are
UPPERCASE
block scope and even if global, not assigned to the Window object
const references to primitive values are always immutable
const bindings are immutable but the contents of objects and arrays are not immutable so the contents can change - it is just the binding to the object or array object which does not change
```



## First Class Object

```
First class object is an object that has methods and properties
Functions in Javascript can have properties and methods
So functions in Javascript are called First Class Objects or First Class Functions!
ie they are Function Objects
They can be passed as an argument to other objects as well, and can even be returned by a function.
They can be assigned as a value to a variable.
```




## Headers in HTML

```
We can view the headers in an HTML page after loading by
going to Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, clicking
on the loaded file and then choosing 'Headers'
```

## History.length/back/forward/go

```js
Accessing Browser History
History object is an ARRAY OF URLS LAST VISITED

history.length() number of URLS

history.back()

history.forward()

history.go(URL) or go(-4)

For security reasons you can't access full list of URLs stored inside history object

Most recent page document.referrer

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)

History has length (back button), back(), forward(), go(x)
```

## Immutable

```js
Immutable objects cannot change
const references to primitive objects are immutable
const x = 10; //this is immutable
const x = {} is not immutable so x.a=10 is fine to add afterwards.
Object.freeze(myObject) can be used to freeze myObject which is made up of key-value pairs, or an array.
```

## Lexical Scoping

Lexical scoping means private scope ie only valid within the block of code in which it is declared.

## Location

location = stats about current URL

location.href is full current URL

location.protocol eg http

location.host/hostname = name of server

location.hash ==> go to part of document where id="#"

protocol://hostname:port/pathname?search=#hash

Location = current URL : href protocol host hostname port pathway search hash

## OnResize Window Event

window.innerWidth/Height

jquery_30_resize_browser.htm

window.onresize()

## Primitive Types

```js
Primitive types in Javascript are
number
string
boolean
symbols
null
undefined
```

## Progressive Javascript Framework

can be introduced gradually into your codebase

## Window - Create, Resize, Manage and Close

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>New Window</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
var eula;
function openWin() {
  eula = window.open("eula.html","eula","height=200,width=300,left=100,top=100");
  eula.focus();
}
function eulaChecked() {
  if (document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked && typeof eula == "undefined") {
    alert("Come on now.  Don't you think you should read the EULA first?");
    document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked = false;
    openWin();
  } else if (document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked && !eula.closed) {
    eula.close();
  } else if (!document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked) {
    openWin();  
  }
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form action="process.xyz">
<input type="checkbox" id="confirmEula" name="confirmEula" onclick="eulaChecked()"> Check to confirm that you agree with our <a href="eula.html" onclick="openWin(); return false;">user agreement</a>.
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Window.Scroll

```js
window.scroll(0,100) SCROLL DOWN 100 PIXELS TO POINT (0,100)
window.scrollTo(0,100) AS ABOVE
window.scrollBy(0,100) SCROLL DOWN A FURTHER 100 PIXELS

# Programming Glossary


## Android Studio

Android Studio is built upon IntelliJ IDEA which is an IDE from JetBrains.

JetBrains also created Kotlin.

Android Studio 3.0 onwards now has built-in [Kotlin](notion://www.notion.so/philanderson888/Random-Programming-Notes-8000-lines-ceef083f617f4874b048d248238f1f3c#kotlin) support.

## BATCH FILES .BAT

```bash
.cmd
.bat
%0 path
%1 name of batch job
%2..9 name of parameters passed to batch job

type outputs to screen, a whole file at that

set a=10

set /p ="Message 1"<nul >data.txt  CREATE data.txt and put data in it

set /p = "Message 2"<nul >>data.txt APPEND to data.txt

set /a total=%int_1%+%int_b% can add 1 to b to output a

IF NOT EXIST %A% (
    ECHO MESSAGE
    EXIT /b -1                          TO EXIT PROGRAM
)

SETLOCAL                                   

IF "%1" neq "/s"                        

PAUSE
```


### Buffer.bytelength

```js
# memory allocated to a string or other object
var buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(15);
var len = buf.byteLength(buf)
console.log(len)
/*
15
*/
var len = Buffer.byteLength('abc')
console.log(len)
/*
3
*/
```


## bun

Bun also has built in

  Nodemon (don’t need this as is has a built in watch mode)

  Dotenv (don’t need this as it reads .env files by default)

  Compiling eg reading .js, .ts, .jsx, etc so no babel, tsc etc required

  Bundling so no esbuild, webpack or parcel

  Jest-compatible test runner so don’t need dependencies to write unit tests

```js
bun install

bun test

const server = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response(“Welcome to Bun!”);
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on localhost:${server.port}`);
```

functional programming 
    uses declarative rather than imperative
        imperative - how to do this, step by step
        declarative - just give the end goal
    avoids sharing state
    uses immutable data
    pure functions
        deterministic gives same output for given input
```













## Keyboard Shortcuts

SHORTCUTS

```
MAC
    CONTROL UP      : SHOW ALL OPEN WINDOWS
    CONTROL LEFT    : MOVE THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS
    COMMAND OPTION ESCAPE : FORCE QUIT
@ turns off displaying command as it gets executed

echo text output to screen

@echo off turns off the command permanently

pause

goto
```




## kotlin

```java
flux is a stream
flow is like a stream with a callback on events onNext, onCompleted, onError
val is immutable
var is mutable
function fun(a: Int, b: Int): Int { return ab } same as {}
lambda { a: Int, b: Int => ab }
```











## php


## php mysqli

```php
require('C:\xampp\htdocs\log\assets\php\connect-db-mysqli.php'); 

$q="UPDATE tasks SET redgreen='$color' WHERE taskid=$taskid"; 
$q="SELECT date, redgreen FROM tasks WHERE taskid=$taskid";

$result = mysqli_query($q) or die (mysql_error()); 
$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);
```



## r


## ruby 


Every class has one parent only

Every class may have several modules

Modules can add new methods

Modules can overload old methods

Metasploit modules overload Msf::Module 

Mixins include one class into another

  Mixins can override a class methods

    eg connect() TCP but connect() overloaded by SMB, FTP

Example of Ruby mixin with overloading

```ruby
class MyParent
     def woof
          puts “woof!”
     end
end

class MyClass > MyParent
end

object = MyClass.new
object.woof() => “woof!”


module MyMixin
     def woof
          puts “hijacked the woof method!”
     end
end

class MyBetterClass > MyClass
     include MyMixin
end
```

<html>
  <script src='/dist/sql-wasm.js'></script>
  <script>
    config = {
      locateFile: filename => `/dist/${filename}`
    }
    // The `initSqlJs` function is globally provided by all of the main dist files if loaded in the browser.
    // We must specify this locateFile function if we are loading a wasm file from anywhere other than the current html page's folder.
    initSqlJs(config).then(function(SQL){
      //Create the database
      const db = new SQL.Database();
      // Run a query without reading the results
      db.run("CREATE TABLE test (col1, col2);");
      // Insert two rows: (1,111) and (2,222)
      db.run("INSERT INTO test VALUES (?,?), (?,?)", [1,111,2,222]);

      // Prepare a statement
      const stmt = db.prepare("SELECT * FROM test WHERE col1 BETWEEN $start AND $end");
      stmt.getAsObject({$start:1, $end:1}); // {col1:1, col2:111}

      // Bind new values
      stmt.bind({$start:1, $end:2});
      while(stmt.step()) { //
        const row = stmt.getAsObject();
        console.log('Here is a row: ' + JSON.stringify(row));
      }
    });

## Kotlin

[Android Studio](notion://www.notion.so/philanderson888/android-studio) 3.0 onwards now has built-in Kotlin support.

Kotlin works hand-in-hand with Java and C++

Kotlin is open source.

You can call Java from Kotlin and Kotlin from Java - both ways can drop in.

## n node manager vs npm node manager

n is a Node module, which can be installed by npm, and nvm is a Bash script.

n and nvm are both still active projects, because it's still more of a bother than updating on Windows. They are still actively maintained, and both have been modified less than 10 days ago.

I find n to be of easier use because it can be installed by npm, but both scripts serve their purpose

## Typescript

Install via NPM or VS Nuget

Note that Visual Studio has full intellisense for typescript

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Create typescript file helloworld.ts

```
function greeter(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

let user = "Jane User";

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

Now compile this typescript file to javascript

```
# typescript compile to javascript the typescript file `helloworld.ts` 
tsc helloworld.ts
```

Now run this with HTML :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head><title>TypeScript</title></head>
    <body>
        <script src="helloworld.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Typescript interfaces

We can use interfaces as a predicted class structure

```
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
function greeter(person: Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
let user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "User" };
document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

## Typescript Classes

Typescript has full support for ES6 classes

```
class Student {
    fullName: string;
    constructor(public firstName: string, public middleInitial: string, public lastName: string) {
        this.fullName = firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName;
    }
}
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
function greeter(person : Person) {
    return "Hello, " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
}
let user = new Student("Jane", "M.", "User");
document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
```

## Typescript tsconfig.json

The presence of tsconfig.json indicates this is the root of a project.

tsconfig specifies
root files
compiler options
