.mjs stands for module javascript and stands for ES javascript using import export syntax

destructuring with alias allows one to destructure an object but then also rename the fields in one go 

currying functions allows you to create multiple versions of a single function

debouncing prevents a function from being called after it was previously called, until a certain time has elapsed.  useful => input form field

```js
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

const search = debounce((query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for ${query}`);
  // Imagine an API call here
}, 300);

document.getElementById('searchInput').addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  search(event.target.value);
});
```

throttling specifies a function is used only once in a given time period, for example scroll event handling

```js
function throttle(func, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function(...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scrolled');
  // Imagine complex calculations or DOM updates here
}, 300);

window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

memoization caches the results of expensive function calls ... and return same results when same inputs are applied

```js
const memoize = (fn) => {
  const cache = {};
  return (...args) => {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (!cache[key]) {
      cache[key] = fn(...args);
    }
    return cache[key];
  };
};

const fibonacci = memoize((n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
});

console.log(fibonacci(40)); // 102334155
```

console.table for js objects

console.time() starts a stopwatch 

console.timeEnd() ends a stopwatch

structured clone creates a full deep clone copy of an object, at all levels

```js
const obj = { 
  a: 1, 
  b: { c: 2 },
  date: new Date(),
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }]
};
const clonedObj = structuredClone(obj);

console.log(clonedObj); 
// { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, date: 2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z, arr: [1, 2, 3], nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }] }
console.log(clonedObj === obj); // false
console.log(clonedObj.b === obj.b); // false
console.log(clonedObj.date === obj.date); // false
console.log(clonedObj.arr === obj.arr); // false
console.log(clonedObj.nestedArr[0] === obj.nestedArr[0]); // false
```

IIFE functions are executed immediately and avoid polluting global scope, helps maintain clean code by avoiding global scope

## sanitising input strings

we can sanitise input strings to stop injection attacks

```js
function sanitize(strings, ...values) {
  return strings.reduce((result, string, i) => {
    let value = values[i - 1];
    if (typeof value === 'string') {
      value = value.replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
                   .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
                   .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
                   .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
                   .replace(/'/g, '&#39;');
    }
    return result + value + string;
  });
}

const userInput = '<script>alert("xss")</script>';
const message = sanitize`User input: ${userInput}`;
console.log(message); // User input: &lt;script&gt;alert("xss")&lt;/script&gt;
```

## 202411 react new features

concurrent rendering manages rendering priorities ... `useTransition`

we can mark some updates as `non-urgent` so more critical renders are run first

react 19 updates

1. Advanced Concurrent Rendering: Making UIs More Responsive

Concurrent rendering was a big step forward in React 18, but React 19 refines it even further. The enhancements in React 19 allow you to manage rendering priorities with more granularity, making your apps feel snappier and more responsive, especially when juggling heavy computations or multiple user interactions.

Code Snippet: Optimizing with useTransition

React’s useTransition hook helps manage state transitions, allowing you to mark updates as non-urgent. This keeps your UI responsive by prioritizing more critical renders first.In this example, startTransition allows React to defer the less urgent state update (search results) until more critical updates are complete, improving user experience during heavy operations.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function SearchComponent() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleSearch = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value);
    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate heavy computation
      const filteredResults = performHeavySearch(event.target.value);
      setResults(filteredResults);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={query} onChange={handleSearch} placeholder="Search..." />
      {isPending ? <p>Loading results...</p> : <ResultList results={results} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`streaming suspense` for real time data fetching

components load data and allow them to begin rendering before all the data has arrived

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load component with data fetching
const UserProfile = React.lazy(() => fetchUserProfileData());

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user profile...</div>}>
      <UserProfile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

async function fetchUserProfileData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  const data = await response.json();
  return () => <ProfileComponent data={data} />;
}
```



`automatic error recovery` to keep apps working smoothly ... uses `onRecoverableError`, `onCaughtTrigger`, `onUncaughtTrigger`



enhanced `developer tools` eg `state inspector`, `component filter improvements`, `performance tab updates`



react `server components` can render parts of the app on the server

```js
// app/server-component.js
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const result = await data.json();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Server-Side Data</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

// pages/index.js
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import ServerComponent from '../app/server-component';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React 19</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading server data...</div>}>
        <ServerComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```


`server actions` means that server-side logic can be run with the `use-server` directive which flags that code should run on the server not the client.

```js
// components/SubmitForm.js
'use server'; // This directive tells React that this function runs on the server

export async function submitForm(data) {
  // Simulate a server-side operation, like saving to a database
  console.log('Processing data on the server:', data);

  // Example of server-side logic
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/save', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to save data on the server.');
  }

  return response.json();
}
```


avoid react `useEffect` ... use server actions and server components

### node programming

npm cache will store all http data

response status eg 200

response json gets the response as json object

response send 

process add listener, event emitter

process argv is array of arguments passed in when process was started

process pid is process pid allocated by operating system at process startup

node_env debug or production

file system create read/write stream for file when sending - this sends the file as a stream of data rather than as a single file

file system read file write file access stat

file system stats is file is directory is socket sizes

npm owner of module

buffer byte length in bytes

os cpus length is the number of cpu cores

closure provides global access to the function and it executes immediately iife

emitter in library 'events' with methods emit on once remove all listeners

stream uses buffer data type 

stream has methods read write duplex transform push end

stream pipe will direct output to a given destination

buffer is raw bits and bytes

buffer alloc will create a buffer of a given size

buffer to string

buffer write

repl read eval print loop can provide a live javascript environment if we just type the word 'node' in the command line

std in out error is standard pipe for sending data in and out of a running program

std in on resume

path sep normalise dirname extname basename

http request app base url ip hostname method originalurl params path query route

http response download end json jsonp redirect render send sendfile sendstatus status

socket emit sends message from one host to another over a given socket of ip:port

source map gets original file back after minification

rest api represational state transfer is standard web api standard

angular 2010 google 

declarative ui designs the ui first and lets the data follow using widgets and state

xslt xsl extensible stylesheet language transformer transforms from one xml to another

class nested static does not have access to parent class members

constructor no-argument eg bike = new Bike()

class Number has subclass byte integer double short long bigdecimal biginteger atomicinteger atomiclong

event publisher notifies that event has taken place

event subscriber is notified of the event

execution stack is the 'stack'

heap stores larger objects with pointers.  memory is reclaimed when no pointers exist to this object.

polling requests data at intervals

### 202410 programming oop

final means a class cannot inherit from this class

static does not need to be instantiated but is available across the whole class

inner class does have access to parent variables

non virtual member cannot be overridden

static final is a constant eg PI

struct cannot inherit

### 202410 aws notes

ec2 is amazon compute cloud also called amazon compute

amazon compute is short for amazon compute cloud also known as ec2

acu azure compute unit is a measure of the power of a machine

acu 100 matches the power of a standard_a1 machine

sku stock keeping unit is a barcode on a product

sku in aws is a unique product for sale eg a given machine with a given spec

ec2 region is geographic area, availability zone is logical subnet within that region, inside which we have local zone which is geographically close to the user, inside which we have outpost which is single data center

ec2 region => zone => local zone => outpost ... 

ec2 region geographic => zone logical => local physical => outpost physical

ec2 has regions which are split into availability zones and these are split into local zones and these are split into aws outposts

ec2 region is geographic

ec2 availability zone is logical grouping within a geographical region, perhaps serviced by different electricity suppliers

ec2 availability zone has one per subnet

ec2 availability zone is a collection of data centers inside a region

ec2 local zones allow placing of rescourcees physically close to you for sake of latency

ec2 outposts put aws services in particular data center

ec2 wavelength zone delivers content to edge of 5g networks to be close to end users on mobile networks

ed2 edge zone is cloud front

### 202410 scripting bash

cht.sh

bash is bourne again shell

ps process status

ls -1 list just names one by one

ls -R list files in subfolders

top top processes  

.bash_profile loads when terminal loads

.zprofile and .zshrc load when zshell loads


```bash
chmod u+x  just for me
chmod +rwx just for me
chmod a+rwx for everyone
man rm
ls -1
ls -a # hidden files
find ~/github -name \\*zshrc\\* # find files containing this name in this folder
open . # opens finder
stdin 0
stdout 1
stderr 2
```

```bash
alias myip=curl 1.2.3.4
function mkcd() { mkdir -p "$@" && cd "&@" }
function gitpush() { git add . && git commit -m "$@" && git push }

Next edit the file ~ /.bash_profile

alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"
alias chrome=open -a "Google Chrome"
alias edge=open -a "Microsoft Edge"

export PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"
source "/Users/tech-a21/.aliases.sh"  # General aliases and functions defined by me
Now opening a new terminal should contain these new scripts
```

```bash
show hidden files and folder ... defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE && killall Finder
function gitTag(){ git tag -a "$1" && -m "$2" && git push -origin tags } 
sudo find / -name \\*bashrc\\*
open .    opens window in finder
open -a "Google Chrome" mysite.html
Edit ~/.bash_profile file and add the following line alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"

.bash_profile is where we set the terminal profile launch settings

.bash_profile / .zsh_profile etc

launchctl setenv name environmentvariable
ps process status
ps aux lists all processes
ps -A lists all processes
top lists top processes
exe does not exist in linux - any file can be executed if it has the 'execute' permission
```

### 202410 scripting - environment variables

### 202410 streaming

dash dynamic adaptive streaming over http - best for high quality and best for on demand streaming. used by shaka, vlc, videojs, libdash

libdash provides open source oop library to mpeg dash streaming for live and vod

scte-35 marker indicates where other content eg adverts can be inserted into a video stream

watermarking helps to protect streaming content 

abr adaptive bitrate streaming assumes that lowering the bitrate is more important than letting the user experience buffering, rendering the most suitable content renditions

rendition is a version of a stream at a given resolution for streaming at a given bitrate

manifest defines files to be fetched as part of adaptive bitrate streaming abr stream

## maths

lower bound

upper bound

significant figures 

congruent means same size and shape

similar means identical in shape but can differ in scale/size eg 2 times bigger, length of sides are in same ratio, area is in ratio, volume is in ratio, etc

pythagoras a squared plus b squared is c squared

sine rule area equals half side a times side b times sin angle C

area of trapezium is half (sum of both parallel sides) times vertical height

volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height of cylinder

surface area of a cylinder is (2 times pi times radius times height ) plus (2 times pi times radius squared)

volume of a pyramid is one third times base area times vertical height

volume of a cone is one third of pi times radius squared times vertical height

surface area of a cone is base area plus cone area which is (pi times radius squared) plus (pi times radius times long edge (not vertical height!))

volume of sphere is 4 thirds pi times radius cubed

surface area of sphere = 4 pi r squared

volume of frustrum is volume of full cone minus volume of top cone

circle area is pi r squared

Cosine Rule: a squared = b squared + c squared - 2bc cosine A

Sine Rule: sin A over A = Sin B over B

Volume of sphere is 4/3 PI R cubed

Volume of cone is 1/3 PI R squared x height

factorisation

quadratic equations in powers of x squared

simultaneous equations

coefficient

translation moving from a to b

reflection in a mirror

rotation about a point or by an angle

enlargement

bearings is angle and distance

rationalise denominator

fibonacci 

sets : x is a member of A 

A n B    intersection

A u B    union

v = u + at

s = ut + 1/2 a t squared

v2 = u2 + 2as

lowest common multiple eg 2, 10 => 10

highest common factor 6,9 => 3

prime factors  

indices

x to power m * x to power n = x to power (m+n)

x to power m / x to power n = x to power (m-n)

(x to power m) to power n = x to power (m*n)

1/(x to power n) = x to power (-n)

x to power 1/2 = square root of x

x to power (1/n) = nth root of x

x to power (m/n) = nth root of x to the power m

surds have irrational roots

irrational cannot be broken down into whole number

root of (ab) = (root of a) * (root of b)

root of (a/b) = (root of a) / (root of b)

floating point number is mantissa * radix to the power exponent
