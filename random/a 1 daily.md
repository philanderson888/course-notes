hello chat gpt are you able to summarise the payments from these credit card statements in a nice neat table with 3 columns - date entered (second date on the transactions), amount and description

date.   amount.     description

ignore any other data on the PDFs - only extract the payment data.  There are 6 pages with 6 small sets of payment data, one on each page.

you don't have to worry about sorting the columns in any order; i will handle that.

thanks






<<shakaib>>

hello brother shakaib how are you?  how is your wife and baby?  i wanted to catch up some time ... maybe with a video call to talk about you and your ministry ... thanks




<<arooj>>

hello precious sister i was telling you that you are the road block and preventing the work from moving forwards because computer work is not your passion - evangelism, love and souls are your passion, not computers!  so i was telling you that i was ready to start about 2 weeks ago!  



can you ask hacker girl to have a look at these courses - what does she think?  https://coderkids.teachable.com/  there are 4 of them





<< arooj >>

also precious sister I have this holy spirit challenge for you ... when we began running the school part of the thinking was that in time we were going to try and have other people contribute to the running and the welfare of the school.  I think I have certainly done my part in helping truly to make sure all funds flow into the school with salaries for 3 teachers and all water electricity and rent has been paid up to date.  As you can see from the group chat the requests for money and help are overwhelming and I have been praying about growing the group.  So ... I would like to have your energy, thinking and prayers involved in this ... as the recipients of my goodness ... and i want to put you to work ... in prayer and practical help ... towards me ... for once ...

i am going to give you 2 months to find one donor who will give funds towards the school on this link ...

if you do not then i will pause on the donations until you do indeed find at least one genuine donor ie not from someone you are just paying to give to the link, and not from just someone local in the church etc ... but a genuine donor of funds ... someone not connected with you or your church in any way.

my goal is prayerfully to engage wealthy people to give to this very needy cause ... but i am not really a fund raiser ... and i don't really have the skill set or the time or the energy to think about these things ... so i am going to engage your services in such a matter.

## charity

ideas on improving the charity

1) work out the number of children under the age of 14 who are served by the ministry
2) every fortnight give a certain amount of money per child ... can use £40 a month as a guide which is £10 a week or £20 a fortnight ... but can also work out how much per child and stick with that eg
   1) shaloom 10 children ... 
3) should I give the money for free ...
4) or should I get them to work for it ...
5) or a mix ie basic salarly plus performance bonue ... 
6) also how often should I give ...
   1) weekly is a lot of stress for everyone
   2) fortnightly would be better i think ... money lasts 14 days 
7) work they have to do for me is ... every 14 days ... post a fresh public link from their social media with request for funds and linking to my social media go fund me page
8) also they have to do basic computing course ... learn how to do basic computing ... javascript ... every child over the age of 8 has to do this ... 
9) i need a person to help me manage
   1)  requests for money
   2)  approvals for money
   3)  how much money to give
   4)  how often to give
10) i also need a computer teacher to help me manage
    1)  how many children of the age of 8 or over ie school year 3? do they have this ?
    2)  for each child they must have a learning path in javascript
    3)  each child must submit some work to prove they are coding in javascript that week ... on a phone ... and get it working ...
    4)  ideally the learning path would be verifiable eg the one to pass the tests ... that is ideal ... but does that demand a computer and an ide ?  would be better initially just a phone ... to get them started?
    5)  the learning path should have a verifiable memory and login which shows the path done and the work done so a screen shot can show the person and their progress ... 
    6)  so ... for every person over the age of 8 ... they will have to earn their money ... by doing the computing work ... 
11) so ... under 8 ie 7 and under ... money is for free
12) and ... 8 and over ... they have to earn the money by doing the computing exercises ... 
13) we will need a learning path ... and an application which is preferably free and which has a memory of what modules have been completed by what date and in what order ...
14) also reading ... we will need some sort of subscription based learning to reading books ... which can be done on a mobile phone ... 
15) i think i will need some sort of a moodle based education system to track the learning of each pupil and to verify the learning has taken place ... and to award payment based on progress ... can pay a certain amount of money per lesson completed ...
16) ok so a progress based reward system where they get paid per lesson done ... 
17) i will need a child to manage this ... 
18) i will need some sort of a database system to manage this as well ... will google spreadsheet do for now ... yes ... perhaps ... or i can build my own app for this? not sure ... maybe not a good idea ...


so ... lets take this to another level

i need

1. to pay someone to come into my house and do my accounts regularly so i have vision on what is happening 
2. to hire a young person who is experienced in google classroom to help set up and manage the whole process
3. to create a google classroom account
4. to create a learning plan
5. to hire a 12 year old to administer the system - this is their job
6. to work with Pastor Victor and Zeeshan to get their buy-in on the program
7. to create a go fund me to attract sponsorship for the 'Learning For Life' education program
8. to create a website to display the vision for education
9. to attract sponsors who can help pay for a child to be on this program
10. to enrol children on to the program
11. every child should have a laptop - a chrome book for example or a windows computer ... perhaps chrome book is better as we dont want children just to be playing games, we really want them learning ...
12. on JesusIsLord.uk website we can create a section called 'Learning For Life' to outline this program and this vision ... how to market it ... and how to sell it ... how to attract sponsors ... 

possibly stop giving money and check - are there any children over the age of 7 ... they can earn money by doing the learning ... or i guess an adult can do this as well ... it need not be a child ... we can feel as we go ... 

we can give payment for 4 weeks ... in that time the 2 children must begin the program and do 8 modules of their choice ... english maths computing and science ... exciting !!! 

program should be run by church ... pastors ... maybe ... payment to the church pastor who will distribute the funds to the child, not sure ??? to the carer of the child ... not sure ... could be an administrative nightmare for the church ... church to spend the money on food, water and other provisions ... with proper receipt ... and funds accounted for ... proper documented accounts ??? payment of equivalent of 1 pound per module completed ... paid fortnightly ... sounds good ... 

pay someone to engage with the children and to create a learning path and to set goals for the next month at a time ... freelancer ... 

pay them on a module completed basis ... they get paid not per month but per module ... -






buy one item of clothing per charity donation

match charity donation financially with spending on myself particularly clothing for now

If anyone is asking for money on social media send them a form and block them . Do not entertain them . 

would it be possible to employ any of these ...

talk to these people and get advice https://actionplanning.co.uk/about-us

take a cold line - no public url - no donation

to manage charity people have this in mind 1) they are not your friends once they transition to asking for help - they are no longer friends but beneficiaries ... so should not be allowed any contact to your social media at all, just purely blocked on both messages and on the platform ... 2) they can have my whatsapp number and will be blocked by default ... 3) they can request funds via the google link ... but there is no guarantee of success and there is no guarantee of amount or timescale ...

## monthly reflection

- future you
- encouragers
- detractors






### monthly up

first opportunity of the day to love god is when i get up first

second opportunity to love god is when i am tired and just stay up

speed 1 ... 2 ... 3/3 this is max speed i can reach

if fail once then temporarily go to speed 0 just for that day

if fail more than once then totally reset to speed 0

go back to bed later - as if satnav not working 

stay up 7 days - join motorway rather than 30mph roads



### monthly dreams

My life will …

Charity 

- Not a charity
- Don’t feel particularly called to this ministry
- Just seeing that there is an incredible need caused by suffering from persecution
- Just really wanting to help as a Christian my brothers and sisters in Christ
- Feel that there is lot of wealth in the western world and I am sure there are lots of well meaning Christians who would be willing and able to help
- Just want to provide a platform for helping multiple people in distress and also to enable visitors to perhaps volunteer to help financially
- Parable Jesus … even though evil is profiting don’t rip up the evil plants because you will rip up the good plants also
- Jesus knew Judas was a thief … yet did not call him out … wow !!!
- All things work together for those who live the Lord and are called according to His purpose …
- Give and it shall be given unto you
- The poor you shall always have with you
- Man gave alms and prayed … that was all noted about him

let the past go
we cannot change the past
are you a believer ... if someone says 'jesus'
what did you mean by that word ... 'f' word
holy spirit ... if someone swears but not to me ... but I can hear them
put yourself in positions where you are forced to grow in faith just like in workouts you put yourself in positions of having to push the weights, do the same with your faith.  Don't sit on it but use it!  Jesus blesses the doers of the word and not the hearers only ...
work harder on your own skills than for your employer ... build and develop your own skill bank 
upskill on medium and javascript weekly

## quotes

goals should be out of reach but not out of sight

when the vision is clear the results will appear

you have to push yourself to your limits ... thats when you grow

the price of regret is much greater than the price of discipline 

what of my life will live on after my death?

dream big ... start small ... act now 

your methods may be messy but your mess will become your message

there are no roses without rain ... adversity is advantage ... obstacle is opportunity

average people focus on money ... excellent people focus on time

you need to let go of yesterday in order to embrace today

you need to be lighter if you want to rise higher …. eg ... unplug all contacts no longer connected with ….

dream big … start small … act now …

## productivity

```
Get To Action
Failing Is One Of Lifes Greatest Teachers
Get into the habit of putting actions in your calendar.
Every Friday or Saturday, I plan my activities for the next week.
Every evening, after work, I review my priorities for the next day and move things around as needed.
And every end of the month, I write down my goals, both professionally and personally, for the next month.
I try to be as specific as possible.
How much mass do I want to put on?
How much money do I want to make?
How many new followers do I want to have?
When you have goals you firmly believe in and you review them at least once every week, you align your plans with your actions.
Journal your heart out.
Do things for others..
```

### productivity in learning

do duolingo 2 lessons daily and 10 at the weekends ... up my game!

I am a Christian - do you have a religion or a faith?

I have also been married 22 years to one beautiful wife and we have six children together 

Say this prayer

Forgive me of my sins O God , I place my trust in Jesus who gave his life for me that I might be forgiven from all my sins and I commit my life to live for the Lord from this day forwards , amen 🙏

We can chat further if you want 


if you are genuine and want to get to know me I can set up a phone call if you are free one of these calendar slots https://calendly.com/philanderson888
…
I work as a senior software engineer building products for Channel 4 television here in the UK, lots of fun and a very demanding job ...
I've been married over 23 years and have a beautiful wife and have been blessed with six beautiful children - truly the Lord has been good to me.
If you want to catch up my social media handles are philanderson888 on facebook, instagram and twitter.
Thanks

Hello lady I am all about making friends, for sure. But I'm not sure if you are genuine or not as I have been approached by a lot of 'single ladies' and mostly the outcome is not good as a lot of them are asking for money or want to become romantically involved. So I am a bit cautious, plus genuine friendship is hard to establish over the internet. I am aged 52, have a wife of 22 years and six children some of whom are at University. So I have a mature life. I don't really have time for trivial chat if I'm not sure that the person on the other end of the chat is genuine. I'm actually a Christian as well and do believe in reaching out to others in friendship and love. I would suggest if you really do want to make friends then maybe call me some time and we can speak and you can perhaps get to see and meet myself and other members of my family as well, and we can say 'hello' properly, thanks. I wish you all the best, thanks. My IG and FB handles are philanderson888

add Jesus loves you after every message

Have you heard about Jesus? That’s whom I invest in and has the best returns ….
Sounds intriguing …
maybe we could chat about it some time although I don’t know what’s in it for you ?
Also I always chat to people verbally with people on the internet before I consider any financial dealings -
have to be cautious that people are genuine I am sure you can appreciate 🙏
Hello thanks for the approach but I am not interested thanks.

Stranger 6 (Vixen)
Not particularly but are you a Christian believer ✝️❤️🙏Jesus loves you girl 🔥❤️ give him your heart and soul 🙏 and his love will flood you for all eternity 🙏 say ‘ Jesus I repent of all sin and believe you died in my place that I would walk free and I will serve you from now on amen

Regardless I would like to encourage you to read through the material provided and pass it on when you are done or return it to me 3 Picardy House thanks 🙏 do you believe there is a heaven? Are you going there?
Love in Christ Jesus and if I can be of any help let me know

got saved

began to preach

gave up university

gave up astrophysics

got a job in admin - something for which i was totally unsuited and untrained and paid rubbish money

got a great job in scottish life but jacked it in after a year due to lust

got a job on building site for 4 years

## london

noved to london

got job in hsbc bank again another industry for which i was untrained and totally unsuited

went to kicc for a while - great church

london was not a nice experience

london was not a nice place to live

left kicc

joined the korean church playing the piano, very badly, but it was beautiful

left that when god spoke to me that i would go crazy ... joined the potters

potters was a hostile environment from the start - isaac in particular opposed my even coming to the church

met zoe and married her

kingsley and isaac were my alter egos and caused me great trouble and pain, and kazeem also in mockery from the band ...

struggled and gained a ministry in the elderly peoples - created a ministry from scratch and ran with it, gaining the much love and group dynamics from the faithful people who were a part of it - it really flowed in prayer and the power of the lord really moved
