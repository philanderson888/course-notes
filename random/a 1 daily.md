Monthly review 

Dreams 

My life will …

Charity 

- Not a charity
- Don’t feel particularly called to this ministry
- Just seeing that there is an incredible need caused by suffering from persecution
- Just really wanting to help as a Christian my brothers and sisters in Christ
- Feel that there is lot of wealth in the western world and I am sure there are lots of well meaning Christians who would be willing and able to help
- Just want to provide a platform for helping multiple people in distress and also to enable visitors to perhaps volunteer to help financially
- Parable Jesus … even though evil is profiting don’t rip up the evil plants because you will rip up the good plants also
- Jesus knew Judas was a thief … yet did not call him out … wow !!!
- All things work together for those who live the Lord and are called according to His purpose …
- Give and it shall be given unto you
- The poor you shall always have with you
- Man gave alms and prayed … that was all noted about him

```
dream in pictures
put yourself in position where forced to grow in faith
work harder on your own skills than those for your employment
upskill 1) medium 2) js weekly 3) udemy 
read bible out loud
failure is my teacher
if i was able to say exactly what is in my heart towards this person what would i say
it's time to rise up and be an employer
the world will get my gift which is preaching to the lost
no drinks in hand at work social events
saved by paper
anointed a leader so still a leader
you cannot trust the flesh in any way ... just get up when you wake up first, thats it
dont be caught out by the voice of the flesh appearing as the voice of the lord
3am to 7pm are my hours
vision is to be up once per day 3am to 7pm - those are my operating hours
let the past go
we cannot change the past
are you a believer ... if someone says 'jesus'
what did you mean by that word ... 'f' word
holy spirit ... if someone swears but not to me ... but I can hear them
put yourself in positions where you are forced to grow in faith just like in workouts you put yourself in positions of having to push the weights, do the same with your faith.  Don't sit on it but use it!  Jesus blesses the doers of the word and not the hearers only ...
work harder on your own skills than for your employer ... build and develop your own skill bank 
upskill on medium and javascript weekly
read bible out loud
step out
fear not
dont be afraid to fail
failure actually teaches us
what do i need to say to communicate all that i would have in my heart to this person?
its time to employ someone eg james or an agency worker
the world is going to get my gift which is preaching to the lost
no drinks in hand at work do
saved by paper
i was anointed a leader so i still am a leader
my weakness is asking for help ... start with rc priest 

have a flow of all items ... current ... move into archive ...

## productivity

```
Get To Action
Failing Is One Of Lifes Greatest Teachers
Get into the habit of putting actions in your calendar.
Every Friday or Saturday, I plan my activities for the next week.
Every evening, after work, I review my priorities for the next day and move things around as needed.
And every end of the month, I write down my goals, both professionally and personally, for the next month.
I try to be as specific as possible.
How much mass do I want to put on?
How much money do I want to make?
How many new followers do I want to have?
When you have goals you firmly believe in and you review them at least once every week, you align your plans with your actions.
Journal your heart out.
Do things for others..
```

I am a Christian - do you have a religion or a faith?

I have also been married 22 years to one beautiful wife and we have six children together 

Say this prayer

Forgive me of my sins O God , I place my trust in Jesus who gave his life for me that I might be forgiven from all my sins and I commit my life to live for the Lord from this day forwards , amen 🙏

We can chat further if you want 


if you are genuine and want to get to know me I can set up a phone call if you are free one of these calendar slots https://calendly.com/philanderson888
…
I work as a senior software engineer building products for Channel 4 television here in the UK, lots of fun and a very demanding job ...
I've been married over 23 years and have a beautiful wife and have been blessed with six beautiful children - truly the Lord has been good to me.
If you want to catch up my social media handles are philanderson888 on facebook, instagram and twitter.
Thanks

Stranger 4  (Vixen)
Hello lady I am all about making friends, for sure. But I'm not sure if you are genuine or not as I have been approached by a lot of 'single ladies' and mostly the outcome is not good as a lot of them are asking for money or want to become romantically involved. So I am a bit cautious, plus genuine friendship is hard to establish over the internet. I am aged 52, have a wife of 22 years and six children some of whom are at University. So I have a mature life. I don't really have time for trivial chat if I'm not sure that the person on the other end of the chat is genuine. I'm actually a Christian as well and do believe in reaching out to others in friendship and love. I would suggest if you really do want to make friends then maybe call me some time and we can speak and you can perhaps get to see and meet myself and other members of my family as well, and we can say 'hello' properly, thanks. I wish you all the best, thanks. My IG and FB handles are philanderson888

add Jesus loves you after every message 

Stranger 5 (Bitcoin)
Have you heard about Jesus? That’s whom I invest in and has the best returns ….
Sounds intriguing …
maybe we could chat about it some time although I don’t know what’s in it for you ?
Also I always chat to people verbally with people on the internet before I consider any financial dealings -
have to be cautious that people are genuine I am sure you can appreciate 🙏
Hello thanks for the approach but I am not interested thanks.

Stranger 6 (Vixen)
Not particularly but are you a Christian believer ✝️❤️🙏Jesus loves you girl 🔥❤️ give him your heart and soul 🙏 and his love will flood you for all eternity 🙏 say ‘ Jesus I repent of all sin and believe you died in my place that I would walk free and I will serve you from now on amen

Hello I am dropping off this leaflet as it is spare and surplus to my requirements and I thought you might enjoy a read and be challenged in your faith - I don't know if you have a faith or not, if you have a religion or not, whether you believe in God or not... Regardless I would like to encourage you to read through the material provided and pass it on when you are done or return it to me 3 Picardy House thanks 🙏 do you believe there is a heaven? Are you going there?
Love in Christ Jesus and if I can be of any help let me know

## childhood

arguing

fighting

loneliness

anguish

lack of certainty

love of astronomy physics and maths

love of roman catholic church

love of single minded leaders and scientists and saints

love of sport

prayer

lust

## teenage

lust

educational excellence

sporting excellence - running rowing pushing my body to the limit

moving around from school to school was disconcerting

lack of social interaction from parents had negative effect

dived into education as a result

top performer at school

winning trophies at school

top performer at university

winning trophies at university

## christianity

got saved

began to preach

gave up university

gave up astrophysics

got a job in admin - something for which i was totally unsuited and untrained and paid rubbish money

got a great job in scottish life but jacked it in after a year due to lust

did a six month course with no money, on the dole, for building

got a job on building site for 4 years

saw revival in the sonrise church during this period

prayed like crazy during this period

saw the power of god move in great intensity during this period

problem with jonathan

problem with mum

problem with simon and sarah

## london

noved to london

got job in hsbc bank again another industry for which i was untrained and totally unsuited

went to kicc for a while - great church

london was not a nice experience

london was not a nice place to live

left kicc

joined the korean church playing the piano, very badly, but it was beautiful

left that when god spoke to me that i would go crazy ... joined the potters

potters was a hostile environment from the start - isaac in particular opposed my even coming to the church

met zoe and married her

kingsley and isaac were my alter egos and caused me great trouble and pain, and kazeem also in mockery from the band ...

struggled and gained a ministry in the elderly peoples - created a ministry from scratch and ran with it, gaining the much love and group dynamics from the faithful people who were a part of it - it really flowed in prayer and the power of the lord really moved
