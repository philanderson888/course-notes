## apps

### regular route joe

Use AI to alert a user when their regular route is down - is this possible? Would have to tap into the regular google maps or apple maps route of the user ... then calculate the regular trip time ... then calculate today the trip time ... then see if there is a faster route ... then let user know 

## improve existing skills

build a website then bin it - get fast

build an app then bin it - get fast

Functional programming key terms 
        
    Pure functions
    
        are Deterministic (output is predictable given the same input) 
    
        Have no side effects 
    
    Function composition 
    
        combine two functions 
    
        Avoid shared state 
    
        shared state force knowing the full history of a variable 
    
    Immutability 
    
        Cannot change the object to which you are bound 
    
        But can still change the properties of the object 
    
        Side effects are interactions which affect other areas and do not just stay within the confines of the function

## homebrew

### install

to install homebrew on mac we run

https://brew.sh

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```


## ide - vscode

Control-E and Control-Shift-E loop through files also bring up search box

- Control-Shift-P - type 'keyboard' and select `Open Keyboard Shortcuts` and now we can enter a keyboard shortcut eg `emmet wrap with abbreviation` and assign a keystroke

- Control-K - delete line

- Alt and Up Arrow - move line

- Shift-Alt-Arrow - duplicate line

- Control - K - C and Control - K - U   comment and uncomment

- Screencast Mode - shows all the clicks visibly when making a video!!!

- Alt and click - multi-select

- Control - Alt - L - select all instances of a word for renaming etc - take care with this one!

<div class="hello">
    - Shift - Shift - P - wrap HTML
</div>

## Mixin

mixins allow code to be `injected`

```java
class MixinParent {
  parentBehaviour() {
    print('parent is doing this');
  }
}

class MixinChild01 extends MixinParent {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild01 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

class MixinChild02 extends MixinParent {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild02 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

class MixinChild03 extends MixinParent with InjectCode01, InjectCode02 {
  @override
  parentBehaviour() {
    print(' ');
    super.parentBehaviour();
    print('mixinChild03 also has some extra unique behaviour');
  }
}

mixin InjectCode01 {
  uniqueBehaviour01() {
    print('doing some pretty unique stuff');
  }
}

mixin InjectCode02 {
  uniqueBehaviour02() {
    print('doing some more pretty unique stuff');
  }
}
```

mixinParent.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild01.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild02.parentBehaviour();
mixinChild03.parentBehaviour();

# Glossary

## BACKBONEJS

```
Model has Key-Value binding
Collections of functions
View has 'declarative' event handling (events declared in UI code)
Connects over RESTful JSON interface
Data represented as Model
	Create
	Validate
	Destroy
	Save to server
	Model changes ==> change 'trigger' event updates all views automatically
	
	Models sync with a 'persistence' layer usually REST API + DATABASE
Collection is GROUP OF MODELS
	var myCollection =  Backbone.collection.extend({url: '/folder'});
	This allows use of the following 
		GET  /books/ .... collection.fetch();
		POST /books/ .... collection.create();
		GET  /books/1 ... model.fetch();
		PUT  /books/1 ... model.save();
		DEL  /books/1 ... model.destroy();
	COLLECTION DATA IS AS AN ARRAY [ {“item1”:”data1”}]
	MODEL DATA IS AS A JSON OBJECT {“FIELD”:”VALUE”}
PARSING JSON RESPONSE FOR THE DATA THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT
	IF COLLECTION COMES BACK WITH EXTRA DATA THEN YOU HAVE TO PARSE FOR THE
	NAMED DATA YOU ACTUALLY WANT 
	{
		“dontwant1”:”dontwantthis”,
		“books”:[
		{ “book1”:”data1” , “title”:”x”} ,
		{ “book2”:”data2” , “title”:”y”}
		]
	}
		SO TO EXTRACT THE DATA YOU WANT (BOOKS ARRAY) USE PARSE
		var Books = Backbone.Collection.extend({
		  url: '/books',
		 parse : function(data){
				return data.books;
			}
		});
```

## Browserify

BUNDLES UP YOUR DEPENDENCIES FOR YOUR BROWSER

[http://browserify.org/](http://browserify.org/)

```
Here is a tutorial on how to use Browserify on the command line to bundle up a simple file called main.js along with all of its dependencies:
		main.js
				var unique = require('uniq');
				var data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6];
				console.log(unique(data));
						
		Install the uniq module with npm:
		
				npm install uniq
		
	Now recursively bundle up all the required modules starting at main.js into a single file called bundle.js with the browserify command:
	browserify main.js -o bundle.js
	Browserify parses the AST for require() calls to traverse the entire dependency graph of your project.
	Drop a single <script> tag into your html and you're done!
	<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```

## Mobile Apps

Lay out the flow and features. Validation of your app idea means that you’ve got something that people want to use. Now is the time to detail your product onto a document, or if you want to go the extra mile, use a wireframing tool.

When putting your idea down on paper, remember to be as detailed as possible. Include the flow of how the user will navigate the app as well as all the features envisioned. This will help your developer to clearly understand your expectations.

Remove non-core features. From the flow and features document you prepared, start looking closely at features that you can remove. Offer only the core value of your app idea. Do not build features in the first version that are "nice to have" and can always be added later as an update. This will help keep the initial costs of development down and also help you get to market quicker.

Put design first.

Hire a designer/developer. Seek a development company that has great design talent and a solid development team. While hiring a developer, go online to check on their credibility and the apps that they have created. If you really liked an app they created from their portfolio, chances are, they could be the right one for your product.

Create developer accounts. You must register for a developer account with the respective app stores to be able to sell your app through their platform. Google’s Android charges $25 a year and Apple charges $99 annually. You have the option of registering as an individual or as a company, if you already have one formed.

Integrate analytics. Analytics help you track downloads, user engagement and retention for your mobile app. Make sure you use tools such as Flurry, which is available for free, and Localytics, that has a free and paid version.

Get feedback quickly and improvise. Once your app goes live on the app store, the first set of customers' usage and behavior will give you insight into how to improve and enhance your app. Enhancements and changes are constant, so keep an eye on user feedback and keep building.

Introduce features. You built version one with limited features and only the core offering. Now is the time to evaluate and introduce the remaining features that were left out in the initial version. You will know through analytics and feedback whether the features are relevant anymore.

### The 3 Most Important Skills to Learn Now to Thrive in 2019

Back in September of last year, I went to live in Cambodia to work remotely on my own startup.

I grew the company from 4 people to 8.

In the course of the next 12 months,

I also lived in Spain, India, Canada, and now I’m in Colombia.

I started 3 businesses,

wrote 2 books (with two bigger ones in process),

wrote 300+ articles on

```
productivity, 

learning, 

life lessons,
```

became a top writer in 16 categories on [Medium.com](http://medium.com/) (including top 1 in Travel and top 5 in Inspiration),

became healthier,

opened my own light coaching program,

learned 36 new skills, etc.

Reading that, you may not guess that I’m actually a software engineer by trade, building video games for a living.

2018 is the year I will fail the most

…and so should you!

Truth is, to become who you really want to become, you’re going to need to change, and change doesn’t happen overnight.

But trust me, it’s not easy.

Of all the skills that contributed to me thriving in 2018, I narrowed it down to the three most important in my opinion.

This also comes from compiling and testing theories in some of the best self-help books in the world.

I ordered them from least to most important in my mind:

Skill #3: Learn to Get to Action

If there’s one thing I can say without any doubt it’s that I’m a pro at getting to action.

I often surprise people with having done something less than 24 hours after we talked about it.

But this is also one of my big weakness.

I tend to charge ahead, sometimes not thinking enough about if I even have the time to commit.

This often led me to do too many things at once, not having the time to deliver quality results.

But I stand by this skill.

In this world, there are underthinkers and there are overthinkers, with hardly anyone in between.

Underthinkers don’t think things through, and hardly follow through.

Overthinkers spend so much time planning that they forget to act. You don’t want to be like that.

Getting to action is also not about not planning.

It’s about planning just enough and carrying through within less than a week of planning.

If you don’t act, you don’t get.

It’s that simple.

Nothing meaningful comes to you for free.

How do I learn this skill?

Get into the habit of putting actions in your calendar.

That’s the first step towards knowing where your time is spent and where you have actual free time.

In your daily planning, always leave room for important but not urgent tasks.

From 5am to 9:30am, I exclusively do things that are not considered my main job. I write, go to the gym and practice 3 skills.

Take notes.

Your memory is not good enough to recall things you’ve heard or seen.

When you can refer back to a thought you had, you’re statistically more likely to act on it.

Take notes in class, while watching videos, while listening to podcasts, while talking to people, etc.

Every Friday or Saturday, I plan my activities for the next week.

Every evening, after work, I review my priorities for the next day and move things around as needed.

And every end of the month, I write down my goals, both professionally and personally, for the next month.

I try to be as specific as possible.

How much mass do I want to put on?

How much money do I want to make?

How many new followers do I want to have?

When you have goals you firmly believe in and you review them at least once every week, you align your plans with your actions.

Journal your heart out.

Sometimes there are too many decisions to take and that clouds our judgment on what we should act on, leaning us to more often than not work on urgent but not important tasks.

Journaling is a great way to free your mind and be aware of all the decisions that are “required” from you.

Do things for others.

That’s an easy but greatly overlooked trick.

I learned to rock climb to help fight my fear of heights.

remember the number one rule to action:

The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

### Skill #2: Learn to Adapt to Change

“It is not the strongest of species that survive; nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the most adaptable to change.” — Charles Darwin

I like to think that I’m a highly adaptable person. I traveled around the world — experiencing over 50 countries, I learn 36 new skills every year (more on that below), surround myself with people of different ethnicities and religions, etc. I’m a software engineer who writes fiction and non-fiction and takes photos semi-professionally. I have adapted to every environment the world has thrown at me, and that allowed me to thrive in the past few years, and especially this year.

Surely you’ve seen the need to adapt yourself. You lost your job, your partner, moved to a new city, etc. You had to adapt if only to not be miserable.

I recently wrote about the fact that it’s okay to not do what you went to school for:

It’s Okay if You Don’t Do What You Went to School For

This morning I attended an event called Happy on Mondays, organized by Mimi Boyer. The guest speakers were inspiring…
People who realize what they studied isn’t for them and adapt to their new environment tend to thrive more than people who settle for their subpar lives.

Simply said: Comfort is opposite of thrive.
How do I learn this skill?
Be positive. Drop negativity. Try to drop negative words from your vocabulary: no, not, bad, etc. Here’s a full list: [https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/negativewords.shtml](https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/negativewords.shtml). When you think and talk positively, you act positively. When you are in a positive mindset, you are more open to other perspectives. When you are more open to other perspectives, you are more receptive to change. It’s fundamental and not too hard if you practice this on a daily basis. If you catch yourself thinking or saying something negative, simply stop yourself and re-phrase.

Be genuinely curious. Ask questions. Curiosity is a skill a lot of high performers have. When you ask more questions than you give answers, that’s when you know you’re on your way to adaptability. In day to day conversations, how often do you inquire about other people? Do you listen to their answer? A practical thing you can do is, at the end of the day, try to recall your conversations and write down the questions you remember the answers to. When you’re in the curiosity mindset, you start to question things you’ve always taken for granted. And when that happens, you start to be more open to change.

Set time aside for important but not urgent tasks. Much like above, it’s important to set blocks of time daily (or close to that) where you can focus on yourself. A time where you focus on things you’ve always wanted to do but never do because “urgent” stuff takes all your time. Take that time to learn languages, other skills, read, journal, work out, explore your city, etc.

Travel. And I’m not talking about a place that looks like home to you. You are from America or Australia? Go to any parts of Africa, the Middle East, India, Mongolia, China, Japan. You’re from India? Come to Canada, especially in Winter. You’re from Europe? Go to Central and South America, East and West Africa, India, China, Japan. You’re from Asia? Go to Europe, Africa or America. You’re from Africa? Again, come to Canada (I’m so biased haha)! Travelling opens your mind to so many different experiences and makes you realize that what you know, well, it isn’t really a universal truth. Things are done differently abroad. Your method is no better than that of others. YOU are no better than others. This will kick your senses in the butt (senses have a butt, right?) and force you to adapt at speeds you never thought you ever could!

Spend time in multicultural cities. Co-living in the same city with people from all around the world is one of the best experiences of my life. When I moved to Toronto, I became way more open-minded, simply by being there and making friends of different ethnicities, backgrounds, religions, etc. If you have the chance, live, if only for a little while, in a city like that. Here’s a list: [https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/california/articles/the-10-most-multicultural-cities-in-the-world/](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/california/articles/the-10-most-multicultural-cities-in-the-world/)

Host people from different countries. Failing to be able to travel to a different country or city, you can always host people from abroad. I’ve done it through Couchsurfing a few times. It’s safe, and frankly a lot of fun. Otherwise, you can host exchange students, expats, immigrants, etc. Having genuine exchanges with people will different perspectives broadens your opinion on things.

Do things out of your comfort zone at least once a week. A while back, I read an article, which I think was from Tim Denning, where he listed a number of things to do that are out of your comfort zone, like having lunch with a homeless person, jumping in the water fully clothed, laying down on the ground in a public place only to stand back up a minute after, pretending nothing happened (I think that was popularized by Tim Ferriss), and more. I tried a few things from his list and it was eye-opening. Try it out!

“I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” — Albert Einstein
Skill #1: Learn to Learn
Back in October of last year, I was doing research on how to learn faster. I was at a point in my life where I thought I wasn’t learning fast enough. That’s when I stumbled upon this video, by Josh Kaufman:

That video changed my life forever. The mental block I had that it took 10,000 hours to learn a skill was completely removed. It does take 10,000 hours to master a skill, but simply learning it? It can take less than 20 hours of “smart” practice. The idea is that you learn the 20% of the material that will yield 80% of the result.

But there’s more to it than that. Cram 20 hours of practice in 3 days and I guarantee you have haven’t learned anything. To learn anything in life, you have to work with your brain. You have to make your brain work for you. More on that below.

Common wisdom says that you need to focus on one thing to be successful. I challenge that thought. One of my favourite quotes is this one:

“The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.” — Robert Greene.
I’m not against focus. I’m also not necessarily against “the one thing”. But how do you know what that “one thing” is until you’ve even tried other things?

And that’s where learning to learn comes in.

We have limited time on this planet before we’re gone. The faster and better you learn, the more you’ll thrive. The problem is, we’re never really taught how to learn which, sadly, should have been our school’s job to do that.

If I thrived in 2018, it’s not because of luck. It’s not because I did the one thing. It’s because I will have deliberately learned 36 new skills. That made me more motivated, adaptable, relatable, versatile, interesting, etc.



First things first, I’d strongly recommend following the Learning to Learn course on Coursera, by Barbara Oakley. It’s free and takes about a month to complete if you practice for 30 minutes a day. I did it in less than three weeks using this approach:

How I Instantly Doubled my Learning Speed Using this Most Simple Trick

If you’ve followed the course, you’ll understand why deliberately learning 36 new skills in a year is important. When you learn new concepts, your brain creates mental chunks. Skills are an assemblage of chunks if you will. When you develop skills, you are in fact creating many different chunks in your brain. And what’s important to note here is that these chunks, even though developed by practicing a specific skill, are actually valuable to learning other skills. Even seemingly unrelated skills.

you have to deliberately work to get your brain to create chunks. 

You need focused periods of time where you deliberately practice a skill and repeat the process over a number of days, weeks or months.

My approach is to learn 3 new skills every month. 

I practice 30 minutes each every morning for 30 days. 

I usually choose skills that work completely different areas of my brain. 

[www.dannyforest.com](http://www.dannyforest.com/)

the more you learn, the faster and easier it becomes to learn other skills, again, thanks to the chunks you previously formed.

There are two other very important aspects of learning: Resting and Smart Repetition.

Resting

By resting, I don’t necessarily mean sleeping. I mean calming your mind to let your subconscious do its work. It has been proven that chunks are indeed getting formed while you rest your mind.

Without going into details, here are some ways to rest your mind:

Cardiovascular activities (walking, jogging, biking, hiking, etc);
Meditation;
Journaling;
Enjoying nature;
Taking a shower or bath; and
Quality sleep.
Smart Repetition
A great book recommendation I have is: How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens

Is practicing the same thing over and over a smart way to learn things?

Well, no. It turns out there’s science showing that there is an optimal time to revisit something you’re trying to learn. This seems to be especially true for non-motor skills.

Basically, you try to space out the repetitions. What you learn today, recall it tomorrow, then after 2 days, then after a week, then after a month, then after a year. Chances are that by then, the knowledge will stick to your brain.

The book goes into more details as to why that is.

Here’s a one-sentence “formula” to summarize how to best learn new skills:

Consistently do focused practice, rest your mind, and repeat in smart ways.

Runner-ups
Choosing 3 skills was insanely difficult. There are so many important factors to thriving that 3 just can’t cover everything. As such, and briefly, here are two I strongly considered putting on the list:

Become Truly Self-Aware
Check out Ryan Holiday’s book: Ego Is The Enemy

Develop Influence
Check out Brendon Burchard’s book: High Performance Habits

Conclusion
Ready to start your journey to make 2019 your best year yet?

I hope you learned something important here and that it’s going to push you to action. Too many people read articles and books, never acting on them. Don’t let this article just be another one of those. If you learn to get to action, adapt to change, and learn to learn, you’re equipped to thrive not only for 2019 but for the rest of your life. So start now before it’s too late.

Exploring Google Play App Signing

When distributing our Android Applications we’ve always been required to sign our APK using a keystore for our application — this has allowed us to ensure that only the developer(s) of our app are able to upload updated APKs to the play console. However, because this keystore acts as a fingerprint to the lifecycle of our application — if anything was to happen to this then we hit a bit of a tricky situation. Because of the disadvantages that the current signing process brings, Google Play App Signing is here to help make things smoother. In this article I want to dive into this App Signing method so that we can get it integrated into our applications.

App Signing is a new process available for developers that allows us to offload the signing of our release APKs onto Google. Once we have provided the Play Console with our app signing key, we can upload our APK and Google will sign them for us prior to delivering it to our users.

Whilst the current way of signing APKs works, there are some flaws which can often bring a little bit of fear to the minds of developers:

If you lose your key then this prevents you from updating your application. Maybe your computer fails, your backup is lost or it is just misplaced in some way — any situation where your key is lost means you will not be able to update your application.
Your key could become compromised by someone with malicious intent — in this case the person with the key can update your application and because there is no way of revoking this access, there’s not too much you can do to regain access to your key.
When using Google App Signing, the huge advantage is that Google manages the signing key for our application — meaning that we can relieve the pressure of being completely responsible for our keystore. When it comes to App Signing there are two different keys that are used for the signing process:

App Signing Key — The key used by Google to sign the APK prior to release
Upload Key — A key used by the developer to upload the APK to the Play Console
As you can see, developers will still be required to keep their own copy of the Upload Key for use when uploading APKs — the difference now is that this Upload Key is not responsible for the signing of a release build, it is simply used to identify the developer who is making the upload. Because this is not a unique key used for signing the release APK of an application, it means that it can be replaced by Google at any time. So if an Upload Key is lost, compromised or should no longer have upload rights for whatever reason then Google can revoke this key and generate a new one for use.

So to sum this up, you can view the Upload Key as an authoritative key, but not a master key — it gives permission for the Developer to upload APKs to the Play Console but not distribute them, that role comes under the permissions of the App Signing Key.

If you’re uploading APKs for your application then this process is completely optional, you are welcome to continue managing your own keys — bearing in mind that you will not be able to make use of any advantages that App Signing brings. For example, if your signing key is lost or compromised then you will not longer be able to upload updated APKs for your application.

When it comes to the Android App Bundle format, App Signing is a compulsory process. This is because when it comes to App Bundles, Google Play needs to be able to sign the APKs for you before distribution — so there is no way to be able to carry out this flow when keys are managed by the developer.

Regardless of whether you’re using APKs or the App Bundle format, let’s take a look at how we can setup App Signing in our own applications.

Porting an existing app
For this example we’re going to take a look at enabled App Signing for an existing application in the Play Console. Before we get started though it is important to note that once you opt-in for App Signing you cannot switch back to manual key management — so be sure that you definitely want to make the switch before you enable it. And if you’re unsure, maybe try it out on a sample app just to be sure (that’s exactly what I did!).

To begin with, we need to navigate to the App Signing section in the console. This can be found in the Navigation Drawer under Release Management > App Signing. When you reach this page, you will be presented with the Terms of Service for App Signing that you will need to accept before you can continue.

On this screen you’ll then notice that you have three options to setup App Signing, we’ll be using the second, You haven’t exported your app signing key, option to export and upload our signing key.

Configure an app signing key

You’ll need to begin by downloading the Play Encrypt Private Key tool (in the form of a jar file) that will be used to encrypt your key before uploading. Once downloaded, you’ll see the command within the setup process that you need to run, this will look a little something like this:

java -jar pepk.jar — keystore=your.keystore — alias=your_alias— output=some_file_name —- encryptionkey=your_encryption_key
Here you’ll execute the pepk.jar file that we previously downloaded and pass some information along as arguments.

To begin with we must provide the path to the keystore which we wish to encrypt.
Next, we provide the alias which is used to access the keystore that we are encrypting.
We then provide a desired file name for the output argument, this will be the name of the file that is generated for us
Finally, the encryption key value which is provided in the code displayed by the Play Console during this process.
When you run this command you will be asked for your keystore password. Upon entering it, the app signing key will be generated and placed in the given output path. At this point you can then upload the key using the given button in the setup process.

Configure an upload key
Just before you hit the enrol button, you may notice an optional section which offers enhanced security for your application signing key — this is referring to the upload key that we previously brushed over and the keystore used to generate this. Whilst this may feel like no change from previously managing a key — the whole point of this is to allow a different key to be used for the upload process than the signing process. The upload key is not a part of the Android security model, so it cannot be used to sign APKs, only upload them.

Generating an upload key is a single step process. We can create a new keystore for our upload process, and then use the following command to generate the required pem file for upload.

keytool -export -rfc -keystore upload-keystore.jks -alias upload -file upload_certificate.pem
Once generated, you will be able to upload this file to the console where requested.

Once you’ve hit enrol, the App Signing screen will be reloaded and you will be shown the success notice for App Signing setup:

You’ll also notice here that there are a collection of fingerprints available for both the Signing and Upload certificates, available for download should they be required.

Now at any point if your upload key is lost of compromised, you can create a new Upload Key using the same steps that we carried above and contact Google through this form to provide a new upload key to be used. Note, only the account owner will be able to make this request.

Signing for new Applications
If you’re creating a new application then this whole process doesn’t apply to you, as App Signing is enabled by default for you! When visiting the App Releases section of the play console for a new application (once you’ve uploaded an APK), you’ll see the following message:

Whilst most of the work here is done for us, there’s a couple of options that we can use to configure our keys here. To begin with, if you choose not to dismiss the message using Continue, you can Opt Out of App Signing by hitting the button shown on the left hand side.

However, you also have the choice to reuse a signing key — this means that the Signing Key used by Google Play for another project of yours can also be used for this new project that you’re creating. This can however pose a security risk as if for whatever reason your account become compromised, then all of your applications that depend on the compromised key could be at risk.

In this article we’ve learnt about what App Signing is and how we can integrate it into our upload / release process. Putting this in place allows you to remove the responsibility of security from your team and let Google take care of that side of things — protecting you from losing or having your key become compromised. If you have any questions about App Signing, or experiences to share of your own then please get in touch!

## bundling

this takes all of the separate libraries and dependencies of your code, and bundles them neatly into one file to speed up the fetching process so multiple http calls do not need to be made, thus drastically reducing the time taken to receive libraries in the background.

Webpack does this job.

## code splitting

this works with [bundling](#bundling) in that, when the bundles get too large the code can be split into components which may or may not be needed immediately.  The components which are not required immediately can be `lazy-loaded` on demand.

RESTFUL means over HTTP
REST faster than SOAP
native app talks to OS
vows
should
cors
`closure : inner function access to outer variables`
gulp better than grunt
promise
generator
webpack
res.status(400)
res.json({a:1})
res.send("text")
Lexical = private scope
Source map - go from minified to regular code
Pug
HapiJS : an alternative framework which has built-in support for input validation, caching, authentication
Auth0 sponsors HapiJS
Express : created 2010 - most popular Node http framework so far
Hapi : best for API
RESTful API uses HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
REST representational state transfer
REST 1) decouple client/server 2) stateless 3) cache 4) layered 5) uniform interface
REST preferred over SOAP as SOAP larger XML requests
Jasmine - has everything built in including assertion and test double utilities
Mocha - just a 'test runner' - no assertion or test double utilities
Jasmine BDD
Mocha BDD
native app - written for a particular OS - gets INSTALLED on a DEVICE, data may be stored on the device
web app - general app for all OS
mongo

Web Glossary

ASCII

Represent ASCII literal as "\u0041"
BigInt

Can hold arbitrarily large integer numbers

Console Output


## javascript

```

javascript:console.log('hi'); // FROM THE BROWSER WINDOW!!! OR URL LINK!!!
console.log() produces black text
[console.info](http://console.info/)() blue text with icon
console.debug() blu
console.warn() yellow with icon
console.error() red with icon
console.table(); tabular output for a JSON object
var x=1; console.log("output %d",x); %d=integer, %s=string, %o=object
console.log('this object is is %o ',this);
console.log('this event is %o ',event);
console.log("%s",new Error().stack);
console.dir(object-goes-here);
console.dirxml(HTML DOM NODE);
console.important()
console.todo()
console.trace() view stack
console.time('x'); start a stopwatch
console.endTime('x') end stopwatch
Debug : Break on HTML change
Monitor('function1');
Debug('functionname');
Toggle device mode chrome
const ... block scope and even if global, not assigned to the Window object
const references to primitive values are always immutable
const bindings are immutable but the contents of objects and arrays are not immutable so the contents can change - it is just the binding to the object or array object which 

use const by default
use let if rebinding is needed
don't use var at all!
Cordova - build multi-platform web apps

npm install -g cordova
cordova create MyApp
cd MyApp
cordova platform add browser
cordova run browser
First Class Object

First class object is an object that has methods and properties
Functions in Javascript can have properties and methods
So functions in Javascript are called First Class Objects or First Class Functions!
ie they are Function Objects
They can be passed as an argument to other objects as well, and can even be returned by a function.
They can be assigned as a value to a variable.
Headers in HTML

We can view the headers in an HTML page after loading by
going to Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, clicking
on the loaded file and then choosing 'Headers'
History.length/back/forward/go


Accessing Browser History
History object is an ARRAY OF URLS LAST VISITED

history.length()  number of URLS

history.back()

history.forward()

history.go(URL) or go(-4)

For security reasons you can't access full list of URLs stored inside history object 

Most recent page document.referrer

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API>

History  has length (back button), back(), forward(), go(x)
```

## Immutable

Immutable objects cannot change
const references to primitive objects are immutable
const x = 10; //this is immutable
const x = {} is not immutable so x.a=10 is fine to add afterwards.
Object.freeze(myObject) can be used to freeze myObject which is made up of key-value pairs, or an array.
Lexical Scoping

Lexical scoping means private scope ie only valid within the block of code in which it is declared.

Location

```
location = stats about current URL

location.href  is full current URL 

location.protocol  eg http

location.host/hostname = name of server

location.hash  ==> go to part of document where id="#"

protocol://hostname:port/pathname?search=#hash

Location = current URL : href protocol host hostname port pathway search hash
```

OnResize Window Event

```
window.innerWidth/Height

jquery_30_resize_browser.htm

window.onresize()
```

Primitive Types

Primitive types in Javascript are
number
string
boolean
symbols
null
undefined
Progressive Javascript Framework

can be introduced gradually into your codebase
Window - Create, Resize, Manage and Close

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>New Window</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
var eula;
function openWin() {
eula = window.open("eula.html","eula","height=200,width=300,left=100,top=100");
eula.focus();
}
function eulaChecked() {
if (document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked && typeof eula == "undefined") {
alert("Come on now. Don't you think you should read the EULA first?");
document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked = false;
openWin();
} else if (document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked && !eula.closed) {
eula.close();
} else if (!document.getElementById("confirmEula").checked) {
openWin();
}
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form action="process.xyz">
<input type="checkbox" id="confirmEula" name="confirmEula" onclick="eulaChecked()"> Check to confirm that you agree with our <a href="eula.html" onclick="openWin(); return false;">user agreement</a>.
</form>
</body>
</html>

Window.Scroll

```
window.scroll(0,100)    SCROLL DOWN 100 PIXELS TO POINT (0,100)

window.scrollTo(0,100)   AS ABOVE

window.scrollBy(0,100)   SCROLL DOWN A FURTHER 100 PIXELS

Javascript Appendix

Javascript - The Good Parts - Douglas Crockford

Topic List

```
Names
Numbers
	64bit same as double
	no int type
Strings
	char does not exist - just use one string with one character!
	"\\u0041" allows ASCII / Unicode literal 
Objects
	Literals
	Prototype
Functions
	Objects
	Literals
		JSON
			x['y']
			x.y preferred as shorter
	Invocation
		Method / Function / Constructor
	Callback
Inheritance
Array
Regex
Functions
Loose Typing
	Don't need complex class hierarchy
	Don't have to cast so much
Dynamic Objects
Expressive Object Literal Notation
Prototypal Inheritance
	Objects directly inherit properties from other objects
Augmenting Types
	Augment 'Function.prototype' with 'method'
	Augment Number to have 'integer' method which returns the integer of a number
	Augment String to have 'trim'
	Note : all values receive new methods even the ones which were created before
	Augment a method only if it is missing
```

New Object Creation : Object.create() method

```
if ( typeof Object.create !== 'function' ){
	Object.create = function(o){
		var F = function(){};
		F.prototype = o;
		return new F();
};
}
```

Replacing the Function.prototye with .method

```
Function.prototype.method = function(name,func){
		this.prototype[name] = func;
		return this;
	}
```

Creating a Number.integer method
</pre>

```
Number.method('integer',function(){
	return this.Math[this<0?'ceil':'floor'](this);
});
```

Creating a 'trim' method for Strings

```
String.method('trim',function(){
		return this.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g,'');
	});
```

Add a method conditionally

```
Function.prototype.method = function(name, func){
	if(!this.prototype[name]){
		this.prototype[name] = func;
		return this;
	}
};
```

Array

```
Create is_array function 
		var is_array = function(value){
			return value && typeof value === 'object' && value.constructor === Array;
	};
```

Things To Change

For..in

```
for (item in myObject){} will iterate of the object but also pull out all methods etc
	To only bring out the members, use
	for (itme in myObject){
	  if(object.hasOwnProperty(item)){  // code }
}
```

Not

```
! 
	use (foo) instead of (foo != 0)
	use (!foo) instead of (foo == 0)
```

Bad Parts

```
Global Variables
	All top level variables are put together in the 'global object'

Unavoidable Bad Parts (Appendix A)
	
	Function Scope : solved with 'let' keyword which gives Block Scope which is what we want
	
	Reserved words
		Many reserved words are not used!
		Can use reserved words but 'escape' with literals
	Unicode 
		<http://unicode.org/charts/>
		Javascript characters 16 bits
		Doesn't cover the 32 bit characters above this - treats as two separate 16 bit characters
	Typeof
		typeof(null) returns object so don't use!  Test instead for x === null
	Testing for type object
		typeof cannot tell between null and an object
		but can use the fact that if(null) returns false 
			if(null) console.log('hello');
				undefined
			if(!null) console.log('hello');
			  hello
	  therefore can use that to code this
	  	if(x && typeof(x)==='object') { //x is object or array }
	parseInt
		parseInt(08) converts from base 8 to base 10 so always use the following
		parseInt(myValue,10) which forces the result to return from base 10!
			(10 is called the 'radix' ie the number to which we count eg radix = 10 for base 10 counting)
	  tip : to convert to binary use x=parseInt(10101010,2) returns 170
	+
		if one string is null, returns the other string
		if both are numbers, adds them
		otherwise concatenate
			good practice : always ensure numbers are used before adding!
	Floating Point 
		0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
		Solution eg money is to multiply into integer whole numbers then convert back at the end
  NaN
  	typeof (NaN === 'number') is true so the type of NaN is a number type
  NaN
  	if NaN is the output then one of the inputs at some stage has been NaN
  	suggested
  	var isNumber = function isNumber(value){return ((typeof(value)==='number') && isFinite(value))};
  	isNumber(2);
			true
		var isNumber = function isNumber(value){return ((typeof(value)==='number') && isFinite(value))};
		isNumber('hi');
		false
	Arrays
		Not like real arrays
		No bounds - can extend like queue/stack
		Typeof is object
		To detect if it is an array you must do
		if (Object.prototype.toString.apply(x)==='[object.Array]'){  // it's an array }
	hasOwnProperty
	objects
	null object
		test for if(typeof count[x] === 'number')

Avoidable Bad Parts (Appendix B)
	==
		use === and !==
	with
		don't use
	eval
	continue
	switch fall through
	undefined is a global variable and you can change its value!
	NaN is a global variable and you can change its value!
	Single line expressions - don't use them !
		if (true)
			y=7;
			never do this but always use proper braces
		if (true) {
			y=7;
	  }
	}
	x++ and ++x - don't use them!  (JSLint bans them!)
	& 
		use &&
	| 
		use ||
	^ xor
	~ not
	>> >>> << bit shift - don't use as slow!
	Function declaration
		use var x = function(){}   NOT function x(){}
		use IIFE
			
			(function(){}()); to invoke an anonymous function
	new keyword
		don't use new Boolean/Number/String/Object/Array
			Object - just use {}
			Array  - just use []
		Better - don't use new at all!
	new with constructor
		new with function 
			if constructor is defined this is OK
			functions that take NEW (with constructor) should be PascalNamed
			functions that don't should be camelNamed
			or better still don't use new!?!?!?
	void
		don't use
	innerHTML
		never directly assign HTML received from a server to an innerHTML element because if it
		is corrupt it can contain a script block! validate it first!?!?!?
	/*  */  can conflict with regex so use // exclusively
	JSLint (Appendix C)
		JSLint is a quality checker for Javascript
		/*global               // lists all deliberate global variables here
		  global_var_01
		*/
		/*members       // lists all members so can check for mis-spellings
			var01,var02
		*/
		/*jslint   */      JSLint options
			eqeqeq forces === always
```

## minimist

minimist can pass in arguments and output them as json

```js
const minimist = require('minimist');
const args = minimist(process.argv.slice(2));
console.log(args);
```

then run

```js
node script.js --option1 value1 --option2 value2
/*
{ option1: 'value1', option2: 'value2' }
*/

pnpm - symlinks to different javascript libraries, is very fast

nvm is node version manager - can be very complex ... perhaps use 'n' instead

n node version manager (not NVM!) ... https://github.com/tj/n .. upgrade and better alternative to nvm ... n is a Node module, which can be installed by npm, and nvm is a Bash script ... n and nvm are both still active projects, because it's still more of a bother than updating on Windows. They are still actively maintained, and both have been modified less than 10 days ago.  ... I find n to be of easier use because it can be installed by npm, but both scripts serve their purpose

lodash .. must better than underscore.js

mux - streaming video 

m3u8 - streaming video url - downloads video in chunks at a given bitrate/streaming quality, which can vary dynamically
