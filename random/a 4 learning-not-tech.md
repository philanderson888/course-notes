## Astronomy


### Asteroid Missions


2023 returning Osiris-Rex from Asteroid Bennu with samples to earth

2016 launched Osiris-Rex to Asteroid Bennu

## Search For Life

```
Venus
Venus may have life!
Scientists have discovered sulphur on Venus which can be produced by volcanic but it doesn't look like volcanically generated sulphur.
They also find hydrogen sulphide H2S and sulphur dioxide. These are incompatible ie when they combine or are present together, then they will naturally react together and eliminate. So it's a puzzle that they both exist. The only solution is that both molecules are being created by something. The answer is life! Life forms are creating both molecules, so is there life on Venus? In the clouds of Venus??? Puzzling!!!
```


### Planetary Exploration - Mars

```
Curiosity is the Mars Rover. It is currently driving round Mars.
https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/
This is a RTG Radioisotope Thermal Generator.
Mars Exploration Spirit and Opportunity in 2004
Spirit Mars Opportunity is solar-powered and is still working!
```


### Planetary Exploration - Venus

```
Russia - 16 Venera probes to Venus

Surveyor probes to the moon
Surveyor III took a soil sampling probe to the moon and was later brought back to earth


2007 - Dawn Probe to the outer solar system     
2015 Dawn flies past Ceres in the Asteroid belt  ....   Shiny white areas are observed. ... Is it ice? The whole planet is ice so what are the patches?   ...  Or are they salts? This would indicate liquid created the conditions to lay down the salt crystals!

## israel conflict

```
Judea and Samaria
Terms used by enemies of Israel
solidarity with Palestine
Israeli 'occupation'
Israeli 'occupation' soldiers shot dead a child
#FreePalestine
#Apartheid
Pillaging Natural Palestinian resources like the dead sea
handicapped victims of Apartheid atrocities
Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians
83 Palestinian children killed by apartheid Israelthis year
#boycottIsrael
Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation

## history of the earth

2.7 billion years ago plants made oxygen using the sun ... planet was transformed

2.7 billion years ago the oxygen reduced much of the earths insulating gases ... and so the temperature of the earth dropped and a series of ice ages began

## ways to go back in time

- ice samples can go back in time ... trapped particles of air inside the snow ice can be analysed
- geological rocks - igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic
  - some rocks lay down annual bands eg where we had an annual cycle of heat,evaporation etc
  - coal is trapped organic matter so can be used to look back in time
  - animals can be fossilised inside rocks and can be viewed

## history - israel

The land of Israel has been populated by the Jewish people since 2000 BC. Here's the timeline, in case you didn't realize that it is their homeland, as designated by Lord Jesus Christ.

1900 BC: Abraham chosen by God as the Father of the Jewish Nation.

1900 BC: Isaac, Abraham's son, rules over Israel.

1850 BC: Jacob, son of Issac, rules over Israel.

1400 BC: Moses leads the people out of Egypt and back to Israel.

1010 BC: King David unites the 12 tribes into one nation.

970 BC: King Solomon, son of David, builds the first temple structure in Jerusalem

930 BC: Israel is divided into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.

800s BC: The rise of the prophets, God's messengers.

722 BC: Kingdom of Israel is conquered by Assyrians.

605 BC: Kingdom Judah is conquered by the Babylonians.

586 BC: Solomon's Temple is destroyed by the Babylonians.

539 BC: Persians conquer the Babylonians and take control of Israel.

538 BC: The Jews return to Israel from exile.

520 BC: The Temple is rebuilt.

450 BC: Reforms made by Ezra and Nehemiah.

433 BC: Malachi is the end of the prophetic age.

432 BC: The last group of Jews return from exile.

333 BC: The Greeks conquer the Persian empire.

323 BC: The Egyptian and Syrian empire take over Israel.

167 BC: Hasmonean's recapture Israel, and the Jews are ruled independently.

70 BC: Romans conquer Israel.

20 BC: King Herod builds the "second" temple

6 BC: Jesus Christ is born in Bethlehem

70 AD: Romans destroy the temple

After that, the people were captives to the Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, and Crusaders. Through all of these events, the Jewish people continued to live in Israel. There were more or less of them, depending on the centuries, but there was never a time when the Jews didn't live in the land. They stayed, they built their communities, they raised their families, practiced their faith and they suffered at the hands of many outside rulers, but they always kept their faith. It is what sustains them, even now.

In 1948, the UN established the State of Israel, the nation of Jews. Don't buy the Palestinian lies that they are entitled to the land. It simply is not true. God will also provide a way for his chosen people to live in Israel, as He has for thousands of years. 

Pray for the people of Israel.

## Jewish Christians

```

For example we celebrate:

His death, burial and resurrection and His blood at  "Feast of Passover" ,

He paid for our sin "Feast of Unleavened bread"

He gave us His Spirit at "Feast of Pentacost."

We shout , blow trumpets and warn  people He is returning soon at "Feast of Trumpets"

We spend a day solely praying to realign our hearts to God/Yahweh ready for our personal judgement at "Feast of Atonement"

We spend 8 days  feasting, partying, dancing, and having joy celebrating Gods 7 day creation , the coming marriage of Christ and the Bride (us the church) and the coming 1000yr reign and new heaven and earth.

pauli exclusion principle 
- fermion has 1/2 spin or 3/2 spin
- electron has 1/2 spin up or down
- boson
- superposition
- lepton single particle
   - electron
   - muon
   - tau
