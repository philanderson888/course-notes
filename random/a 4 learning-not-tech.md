## Astronomy


### Asteroid Missions


2023 returning Osiris-Rex from Asteroid Bennu with samples to earth

2016 launched Osiris-Rex to Asteroid Bennu

## Search For Life

```
Venus
Venus may have life!
Scientists have discovered sulphur on Venus which can be produced by volcanic but it doesn't look like volcanically generated sulphur.
They also find hydrogen sulphide H2S and sulphur dioxide. These are incompatible ie when they combine or are present together, then they will naturally react together and eliminate. So it's a puzzle that they both exist. The only solution is that both molecules are being created by something. The answer is life! Life forms are creating both molecules, so is there life on Venus? In the clouds of Venus??? Puzzling!!!
```


### Planetary Exploration - Mars

```
Curiosity is the Mars Rover. It is currently driving round Mars.
https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/
This is a RTG Radioisotope Thermal Generator.
Mars Exploration Spirit and Opportunity in 2004
Spirit Mars Opportunity is solar-powered and is still working!
```


### Planetary Exploration - Venus

```
Russia - 16 Venera probes to Venus 
Nasa - Pioneer to research the possibility of life on Venus in the clouds

1975 Viking I to Mars
1976 Viking II to Mars reached the surface


DART crash into asteroid to divert it (Double Asteroid Redirection Test)


? Mars Rover got stuck


? Mars Opportunity still going 2023


? Mars Curiosity planned use is 2 years powered by Plutonium
? Mars Perseverance


Surveyor probes to the moon
Surveyor III took a soil sampling probe to the moon and was later brought back to earth


2007 - Dawn Probe to the outer solar system     
2015 Dawn flies past Ceres in the Asteroid belt  ....   Shiny white areas are observed. ... Is it ice? The whole planet is ice so what are the patches?   ...  Or are they salts? This would indicate liquid created the conditions to lay down the salt crystals!

### Political Conflict

```
Judea and Samaria
Terms used by enemies of Israel
solidarity with Palestine
Israeli 'occupation'
Israeli 'occupation' soldiers shot dead a child
#FreePalestine
#Apartheid
Pillaging Natural Palestinian resources like the dead sea
handicapped victims of Apartheid atrocities
Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians
83 Palestinian children killed by apartheid Israelthis year
#boycottIsrael
Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation
Life
        - When does life begin?
