## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation
Life
        - When does life begin?
            - videos of a baby developing

## history of the earth

2.7 billion years ago plants made oxygen using the sun ... planet was transformed

2.7 billion years ago the oxygen reduced much of the earths insulating gases ... and so the temperature of the earth dropped and a series of ice ages began

## ways to go back in time

- ice samples can go back in time ... trapped particles of air inside the snow ice can be analysed
- geological rocks - igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic
  - some rocks lay down annual bands eg where we had an annual cycle of heat,evaporation etc
  - coal is trapped organic matter so can be used to look back in time
  - animals can be fossilised inside rocks and can be viewed
- doppler red shift for items across the galaxy

## history - israel

The land of Israel has been populated by the Jewish people since 2000 BC. Here's the timeline, in case you didn't realize that it is their homeland, as designated by Lord Jesus Christ.

1900 BC: Abraham chosen by God as the Father of the Jewish Nation.

1900 BC: Isaac, Abraham's son, rules over Israel.

1850 BC: Jacob, son of Issac, rules over Israel.

1400 BC: Moses leads the people out of Egypt and back to Israel.

1010 BC: King David unites the 12 tribes into one nation.

970 BC: King Solomon, son of David, builds the first temple structure in Jerusalem

930 BC: Israel is divided into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.

800s BC: The rise of the prophets, God's messengers.

722 BC: Kingdom of Israel is conquered by Assyrians.

605 BC: Kingdom Judah is conquered by the Babylonians.

586 BC: Solomon's Temple is destroyed by the Babylonians.

539 BC: Persians conquer the Babylonians and take control of Israel.

538 BC: The Jews return to Israel from exile.

520 BC: The Temple is rebuilt.

450 BC: Reforms made by Ezra and Nehemiah.

433 BC: Malachi is the end of the prophetic age.

432 BC: The last group of Jews return from exile.

333 BC: The Greeks conquer the Persian empire.

323 BC: The Egyptian and Syrian empire take over Israel.

167 BC: Hasmonean's recapture Israel, and the Jews are ruled independently.

70 BC: Romans conquer Israel.

20 BC: King Herod builds the "second" temple

6 BC: Jesus Christ is born in Bethlehem

70 AD: Romans destroy the temple

After that, the people were captives to the Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, and Crusaders. Through all of these events, the Jewish people continued to live in Israel. There were more or less of them, depending on the centuries, but there was never a time when the Jews didn't live in the land. They stayed, they built their communities, they raised their families, practiced their faith and they suffered at the hands of many outside rulers, but they always kept their faith. It is what sustains them, even now.

In 1948, the UN established the State of Israel, the nation of Jews. Don't buy the Palestinian lies that they are entitled to the land. It simply is not true. God will also provide a way for his chosen people to live in Israel, as He has for thousands of years. 

Pray for the people of Israel.
