destructuring with alias allows one to destructure an object but then also rename the fields in one go 

currying functions allows you to create multiple versions of a single function

debouncing prevents a function from being called after it was previously called, until a certain time has elapsed.  useful => input form field

```js
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

const search = debounce((query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for ${query}`);
  // Imagine an API call here
}, 300);

document.getElementById('searchInput').addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  search(event.target.value);
});
```

throttling specifies a function is used only once in a given time period, for example scroll event handling

```js
function throttle(func, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function(...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scrolled');
  // Imagine complex calculations or DOM updates here
}, 300);

window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

memoization caches the results of expensive function calls ... and return same results when same inputs are applied

```js
const memoize = (fn) => {
  const cache = {};
  return (...args) => {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (!cache[key]) {
      cache[key] = fn(...args);
    }
    return cache[key];
  };
};

const fibonacci = memoize((n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
});

console.log(fibonacci(40)); // 102334155
```

console.table for js objects

console.time() starts a stopwatch 

console.timeEnd() ends a stopwatch

structured clone creates a full deep clone copy of an object, at all levels

```js
const obj = { 
  a: 1, 
  b: { c: 2 },
  date: new Date(),
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }]
};
const clonedObj = structuredClone(obj);

console.log(clonedObj); 
// { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, date: 2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z, arr: [1, 2, 3], nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }] }
console.log(clonedObj === obj); // false
console.log(clonedObj.b === obj.b); // false
console.log(clonedObj.date === obj.date); // false
console.log(clonedObj.arr === obj.arr); // false
console.log(clonedObj.nestedArr[0] === obj.nestedArr[0]); // false
```

IIFE functions are executed immediately and avoid polluting global scope, helps maintain clean code by avoiding global scope

## sanitising input strings

we can sanitise input strings to stop injection attacks

```js
function sanitize(strings, ...values) {
  return strings.reduce((result, string, i) => {
    let value = values[i - 1];
    if (typeof value === 'string') {
      value = value.replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
                   .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
                   .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
                   .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
                   .replace(/'/g, '&#39;');
    }
    return result + value + string;
  });
}

const userInput = '<script>alert("xss")</script>';
const message = sanitize`User input: ${userInput}`;
console.log(message); // User input: &lt;script&gt;alert("xss")&lt;/script&gt;
```

## 202411 react new features

concurrent rendering manages rendering priorities ... `useTransition`

we can mark some updates as `non-urgent` so more critical renders are run first

react 19 updates

1. Advanced Concurrent Rendering: Making UIs More Responsive

Concurrent rendering was a big step forward in React 18, but React 19 refines it even further. The enhancements in React 19 allow you to manage rendering priorities with more granularity, making your apps feel snappier and more responsive, especially when juggling heavy computations or multiple user interactions.

Code Snippet: Optimizing with useTransition

React’s useTransition hook helps manage state transitions, allowing you to mark updates as non-urgent. This keeps your UI responsive by prioritizing more critical renders first.In this example, startTransition allows React to defer the less urgent state update (search results) until more critical updates are complete, improving user experience during heavy operations.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function SearchComponent() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleSearch = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value);
    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate heavy computation
      const filteredResults = performHeavySearch(event.target.value);
      setResults(filteredResults);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={query} onChange={handleSearch} placeholder="Search..." />
      {isPending ? <p>Loading results...</p> : <ResultList results={results} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`streaming suspense` for real time data fetching

components load data and allow them to begin rendering before all the data has arrived

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load component with data fetching
const UserProfile = React.lazy(() => fetchUserProfileData());

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user profile...</div>}>
      <UserProfile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

async function fetchUserProfileData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  const data = await response.json();
  return () => <ProfileComponent data={data} />;
}
```



`automatic error recovery` to keep apps working smoothly ... uses `onRecoverableError`, `onCaughtTrigger`, `onUncaughtTrigger`



enhanced `developer tools` eg `state inspector`, `component filter improvements`, `performance tab updates`



react `server components` can render parts of the app on the server

```js
// app/server-component.js
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const result = await data.json();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Server-Side Data</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

// pages/index.js
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import ServerComponent from '../app/server-component';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React 19</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading server data...</div>}>
        <ServerComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```


`server actions` means that server-side logic can be run with the `use-server` directive which flags that code should run on the server not the client.

```js
// components/SubmitForm.js
'use server'; // This directive tells React that this function runs on the server

export async function submitForm(data) {
  // Simulate a server-side operation, like saving to a database
  console.log('Processing data on the server:', data);

  // Example of server-side logic
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/save', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to save data on the server.');
  }

  return response.json();
}
```


avoid react `useEffect` ... use server actions and server components

container runs app

container is a virtual operating system configured so an app just installs and runs 

load balancer 

application load balancer has path routing to different target groups and host routing to different hosts, also has a waf web app firewall.

application load balancer is good when using containers to route traffic for your app

application load balancer request tracing will log all http requests

rds relational database service eg auorora, postgres, mariadb oracledb

aws dynamo db is non relational

s3 ebs elastic block storage mimics real hard drive 

s3 ebs elastic block storage has block level replication, volume snapshots, encrypted volumes, dynamic resize

ads aws directory service which uses microsoft active diretory service

iam congnito sign in via 3rd party apps eg facebook

iam roles apply to apps

cloudwatch has events logs alarms

dash dynamic adaptive streaming over http - best for high quality and best for on demand streaming. used by shaka, vlc, videojs, libdash

libdash provides open source oop library to mpeg dash streaming for live and vod

scte-35 marker indicates where other content eg adverts can be inserted into a video stream

watermarking helps to protect streaming content 

abr adaptive bitrate streaming assumes that lowering the bitrate is more important than letting the user experience buffering, rendering the most suitable content renditions

rendition is a version of a stream at a given resolution for streaming at a given bitrate

manifest defines files to be fetched as part of adaptive bitrate streaming abr stream

## maths

lower bound

upper bound

significant figures 

congruent means same size and shape

similar means identical in shape but can differ in scale/size eg 2 times bigger, length of sides are in same ratio, area is in ratio, volume is in ratio, etc

pythagoras a squared plus b squared is c squared

sine rule area equals half side a times side b times sin angle C

area of trapezium is half (sum of both parallel sides) times vertical height

volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height of cylinder

surface area of a cylinder is (2 times pi times radius times height ) plus (2 times pi times radius squared)

volume of a pyramid is one third times base area times vertical height

volume of a cone is one third of pi times radius squared times vertical height

surface area of a cone is base area plus cone area which is (pi times radius squared) plus (pi times radius times long edge (not vertical height!))

volume of sphere is 4 thirds pi times radius cubed

surface area of sphere = 4 pi r squared

volume of frustrum is volume of full cone minus volume of top cone

circle area is pi r squared

Cosine Rule: a squared = b squared + c squared - 2bc cosine A

Sine Rule: sin A over A = Sin B over B

Volume of sphere is 4/3 PI R cubed

Volume of cone is 1/3 PI R squared x height

factorisation

quadratic equations in powers of x squared

simultaneous equations

coefficient

translation moving from a to b

reflection in a mirror

rotation about a point or by an angle

enlargement

bearings is angle and distance

rationalise denominator

fibonacci 

sets : x is a member of A 

A n B    intersection

A u B    union

v = u + at

s = ut + 1/2 a t squared

v2 = u2 + 2as

lowest common multiple eg 2, 10 => 10

highest common factor 6,9 => 3

prime factors  

indices

x to power m * x to power n = x to power (m+n)

x to power m / x to power n = x to power (m-n)

(x to power m) to power n = x to power (m*n)

1/(x to power n) = x to power (-n)

x to power 1/2 = square root of x

x to power (1/n) = nth root of x

x to power (m/n) = nth root of x to the power m

surds have irrational roots

irrational cannot be broken down into whole number

root of (ab) = (root of a) * (root of b)

root of (a/b) = (root of a) / (root of b)

floating point number is mantissa * radix to the power exponent

### big data

- Apache Hadoop allows for distributed processing 
- Apache Spark runs data engineering on clusters
- Apache Hive stores big data to SQL
- Apache Kafka is used for big data stream processing



### azure

- application insights - app stats and issues
- DocumentDB is NoSQL
- ExpressRoute
- HDInsight is big data analytics
- StorSimple - cloud NAS/SAN
- Traffic Manager - DNS and load balancing
- Fabric Controller manages VM clusters
- identity
  - can sync with local AD
  - ADFS Federated Services can provide identity services eg 2FA across platforms

# AWS

#### IAM Security

- Principal is the person we are giving permissions to 
- Action is what is being applied
- Resource is which properties are being accessed

Least Privilege - minimal permissions

##### IAM Policy

    - Identity Policy applies to a principal
    - Resource Policy applies to a resource

#### Network Security

Defense in depth : multi-layered approach

##### VPC Virtual Private Cloud

This is a logical network to which permissions can be applied

It consists of 

- Subnet (ranges of IP)
- Route tables to direct traffic
- Gateway to communicate with outside world


### AWS secure web app demo 

in Intro to AWS Cloud Security Course at Secure Communication part

```
Goal : communicate web app to database in AWS
decrypt data with key
view app logs CloudTrail
view aws logs CloudWatch
```

## AWS Container Services

- RDS - we secure data and access
- EMR Elastic Map Reduce allows Big Data Frameworks to run in the cloud - we secure data and access
- Elastic Beanstalk - deploy apps - user configures firewall and encrypts data

## AWS Abstracted Services

```
customer receives endpoint url

S3 storage
DynamoDB (NoSQL)
SQS Simple Queuing Service which can trigger a lambda function
Glacier stores cold archive data
```

## AWS Environment Security

### IAM

```
Can provide access to users
Can authorize access to resources
Can authorize federated users eg Facebook or Google users in IAM=>IdentityProviders

IAM Policy to allow open access
{
"Sid":
"Effect":....
"Action":"dynamodb":*",
"Resource":"*"
}

IAM for one table
{
"Sid":
"Effect":"Allow",
"Action [
 "dynamodb:Get*",
 "dynamodb:Query"
],
"Resource":"arn:aws:dynamodb":*:*:table/MyTable"
}

```

### AWS Cloudwatch Application Logs

```
Important to have application logs for troubleshooting
Can query logs
Alarms
  Alert admins with SNS Simple Notification Service
  Autoscaling when CPU exceeds EC2 threshold (also called elastic scaling)
Demo
    Cloudwatch > Logs > /name-of-service/name-of-event/hash-of-log
    Logs => can create an alarm also => metrics => lambda => select function => choose to
    alarm on errors
  

```

### Amazon Inspector : Vulnerability Scanning

```
Provides vulnerability scan
Recommend best practice
Can install agents on EC2 instances also directly
Limit possibility of cyber attack
```








# AWS Container Security

AWS manage OS and service

AWS and customer share

IAM

firewall

Customer secures data

## AWS VPC Virtual Private Cloud

Lab in ‘Intro to AWS Cloud Security’ Pluralsight

Create a subnet

public

private

Gateway to internet or private network

NAT allow private instances access to public internet

Virtual private cloud consists of a least 2 subnets : one private and one public

Private subnet

- Database
- Background Services

Public subnet

- NAT Gateway
- Web instances

both subnets connect to a router which connects to the internet

should restrict unauthorised access

### AWS KMS key service

- Customer Master Key can be managed by customer or AWS
- KMS protected in HSM hardware module

### AWS Example : Bank

Access via API which calls database. Data is encrypted on database but decrypted with KMS key and sent to customer

### RDS relational database

### EMR big data

### Elastic beanstalk - app deployment

### AWS Environment Variables

In JSON files AWS keys can be kept in %USERPROFILE%.aws\\credentials file for example

[default]
aws_access_key_id=<your access key id>
aws_secret_access_key=<your secret access key>

## Serverless Computing

# Load Balancing

NGINX
API Gateway
nginx.com
AWS Route53
Auto scaling
NGINX controller
Caching content
Content distribution networks
AWS Pattern
AWS Quick Start guide to NGINX
Load balancers solve the problem of 
   Performance
   Scale up : Vertical : More CPU/RAM/Hard Drive
   Scale out : horizontal : add more computers
   Availability
   Economy
Server-side load balancers
Network load balancers : OSI layer 3 : good for balancing raw network load
Application load balancers : OSI layer 7 : more advanced as content of packets known
IAAS Infrastructure As A Service - render VM via API

## Types Of Load Balancer

### Cloud

Elastic Load Balancer (AWS)

ALB Application Load Balancer

NLB Network Load Balancer

### Ported from real machines

### Software Load Balancer
Installed on top of OS

### Global Route Balancing With Route 53
Enables you to direct your users to the closest endpoint geographically around the globe
Geolocation routing allows specifying endpoints by region geographically

### Latency-based routing
Detects closest region based on lowest DNS latency which beats geographic distance

## Considerations Of Load Balancing

### Scaling Infrastructure

Must be able to register and de-register nodes from load balancing pools through automation

### Scaling Load Balancers

Must be able to scale load balancers

### NGINX Load Balancing

- NGINX is an Application Deliver Contoller
- NGINX is a load balancer
- NGINX is a reverse proxy
- NGINX can load balance TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, Email
- NGINX is extensible via C and LUA
- NGINX has MODSECURITY3 which turns NGINX into a WAF Web Application Firewall
- NGINX offers authentication via JWT web tokens`

### restric access
chmod 400 keypair.pem
EC2 => instance => connect => use given code to connect
```

### AWS RDS database access

```
Create mysql database
add security group with inbound and outbound rules
can configure inbound rules to only allow set ip addresses
```

### AWS Securing Access To S3

```
view files
create public files
restrict access to bucket
 - public
 - access control list
 - bucket policies

Lab
Create bucket
Add image
Make image public
Click on URL to view image in browser

Access by 
- public ?
- access control lists
- advanced bucket policy for others to access eg restrict access per user in a shared s3
   bucket

```

### Installing Linux with a GUI

```
# install basic terminal tools
sudo apt install tmux git ranger vim
# 2GB download takes a while
sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop -y

## Vagrant

### Vagrant : get started guide

[https://learn.hashicorp.com/vagrant/#getting-started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vagrant/#getting-started)

Vagrant can use scripts from `Packer`, `Chef` or `Ansible` to provsion and create and run virtual machines

### Vagrant with Hyper-V

```
# enable with 
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
# create and run first default vm  (this failed on Windows!)
vagrant box add hashicorp/bionic64
# show machines
vagrant box list
vagrant up 
```

### Vagrant With Virtualbox

[https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/dev-environments](https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/dev-environments)

```
choco install virtualbox -y
choco install vagrant -y
restart-computer
```


Virtual box drivers are not installed !
Manually install : right click on .inf and install

### CMD (not powershell) terminal as admin :
sc start vboxdrv

Control panel => Network Adapters => VBox Host Only Network 
 => Properties => Install => Service => Add => Oracle 
 => choose the only service there => OK

Remove HyperV

### Vagrant Initial Steps

Vagrant files are written in Ruby!

```bash
# Create Vagrantfile
vagrant init

# Set a more specific version
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

### This is the copy of the Vagrant file which works now
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
end

# In windows, make sure HyperV is not conflicting with VirtualBox - turn it off and reboot
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off          (on or auto to restore it)

# turn on (5-10 minutes)
vagrant up

# log in
vagrant ssh

# update
sudo apt-get update -y

# install nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

# start nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# check if running
ps aux | grep nginx
service nginx status

# start also with this command
sudo service nginx start/stop
    

# see which service is using port 80
netstat -tulpn | grep :80

# if it works you can now do, in a browser
http://localhost:80  
# and a web page will appear

# reload machine with new configuration
vagrant reload

# or

# take down vm then boot up again

```bash
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```

# set dns

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```

# add to config fileconfig.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

# this is the script which works


```bash
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]
end
```

# Now access via 

http://192.168.10.100

http://development.local


## Provisioning

[https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/provisioning](https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/provisioning)

Provision = configure and setup an environment

- Folders
- Files
- Programs
- Scripts

### Provision A Folder

```bash
# maps /app to /app on VM

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

  # Synced app folder
  config.vm.synced_folder "app", "/app"
  config.vm.synced_folder "c:/app", ls"/app"  # windows

end
```

### which

```bash
# find out the path to an executable
which ruby
```

### update and upgrade

```bash
# update metadata
sudo apt update
# upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### nginx

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

### Provisioning an environment

```bash
mkdir environment
cd environment
touch provision.sh

# add this to provision.sh

#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
sudo npm install pm2 -g


# Now add this provisioning to our Vagrant script

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

  # Synced app folder
  config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/Shared/Vagrant/starter-code/app", "/home/ubuntu/app"

  # Provisioning
  config.vm.provision "shell", path: "environment/provision.sh"

end

# Try running the app with (on Windows)

vagrant destroy -f; vagrant up; vagrant ssh 

# also play around with adding data to files remotely
# add to new file

### Docker Environment Variables

The standard for protecting sensitive credentials in production environments is to use Environment Variables Docker, via docker-compose and docker-compose.yml, easily allows developers to introduce environment variables and values, but you don’t want to commit those to a repo, so the answer is creating a docker-compose.override.yml file on your local machine which contains the sensitive information: The information in docker-compose.override.yml is added to (or overrides) the directives in docker-compose.yml. Since git and mercurial will allow you to commit docker-compose.override.yml files, the other important step is adding your docker-compose.override.yml file to your .gitignore or .hgignore file, preventing the file from being seen from the two version control tools. docker-compose.override.yml

### Docker Compose - YAML multi-docker environments

# Kubernetes

Orchestrates multiple containers

## Kubernetes Terminology

## Orchestration

- so we don’t have to deploy containers individually
- picture of real coordination in a real orchestra

    Orchestrator : dynamic management

    ```
        Examples : Kubernetes, DC/OS, Nomad, Swarm
    ```

```
Master - controls replication, scheduling, external load balancers, public ip
Node - like a VM running container images
Pod - service consisting of one or more container images
   

Master - coordinates the cluster - schedules, maintains state, scales, rolls out updates
Node - VM or physical computer which serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster
Kubelet - agent software on each Node - manages the node and communicates with the master
Kubernetes API - Exposed by the master and used by the nodes and end users
Cluster
Minikube - lightweight version of Kubernetes
   cluster   -   start, stop, status, delete
```

```

### Kubernetes Deployments

We can `deploy` our apps into our `cluster`

To do this we create a `deployment configuration`

`Deployment configuration` instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of the application.

`Kubernetes Deployment Controller` monitors running instances. If a node fails, another instance is spun up on another node. This is called `self-healing`. Before orchestration we would manually use scripts to start the applications but there was no self-healing.

A `Kubernetes Cluster` consists of the master node with the deployment instructions, and other nodes which run the containerised app.

## Kubernetes Deployment Tutorial

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics>
                              /deploy-app/deploy-interactive/

# show all nodes 

kubectl get nodes
 
kubectl version

1. Find node (only 1 here) to deploy on
2. Run the app
3. Configure to re-run if the node collapses

```bash
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
```

4 look at deployments - shows the running app

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

5. expose our app to a proxy web address

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

6. view data

```bash
curl <http://localhost:8001/version>  or /  or /api  or /apis
```

7. run in a new terminal window 

```bash
print "\\n\\n\\n"
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

echo (kubectl get pods -o go-template --template 
               '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}')

set-item -Path Env:POD_NAME -value (kubectl get pods -o go-template 
            --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}')
```

## Kubernetes Pods And Nodes

A `node` is a worker machine in a cluster. It can contain one or more `pods`

A `pod` can contain one or more containers for example one container for the storage and another one for the application.

- shared storage
- IP
- Ports
- Container image version

A `pod` represents a logical application host. It can contain different `application containers` eg an app and the data

Pod containers are

- co-located
- share IP
- share port
- co-scheduled

Pod is the atomic unit on the `Kubernetes` platform

In case of failure, pods can be put onto other nodes.

Pods run on `nodes` which may be a physical or virtual machine depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the `master` One node can have multiple `pods` and the master handles this.

Every node runs

- Kubelet = process to run communication between Node and master
- Container runtime which
    - gets the image
    - unpacks the image
    - runs the application

## Extra Kubernetes Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods

kubectl logs

kubectl exec
```

## Kubernetes Services

![https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg)

https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg

A cluster node holds several pods. A cluster has an IP

Each pod can have an IP internally which is not exposed unless deliberately by the `service`

A `service` defines a logical set of pods and their coupling via a YAML or JSON file.

The set of pods are targeted using a `LabelSelector`

`Services` can be exposed in different ways

- ClusterIP Reachable only internally (default)
- NodePort IP:Port reachable externally
- LoadBalancer (fixed external IP routes queries in)
- ExternalName kube-dns

`Services` can group across `pods` and even across `nodes` and can expose a service IP address which is different to each pod IP.

Each item in a service can be `tagged` with that service name

## Kubernetes Service Tutorial

[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-interactive/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-interactive/)

```bash
# Learn how to expose an app outside the cluster with `kubectl expose` command
# Apply labels/tags to objects with `kubectl label` command
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080
kubectl get services
kubectl describe services
# export kube the Node port number as a variable and then connect to it with curl
# service is exposed on internet but not on local powershell demo!
curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT 

## use labels (works on web demo)
kubectl get pods -l run=hello-minikube 
## same on powershell
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl get pods -n default
kubectl describe pods

# Running the same tutorial via powershell on local machine
minikube version
minikube start
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

# returns for example 32104 which is the port exposed by the service
echo (kubectl get services/hello-minikube -o go-template --template '{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
curl $(minikube ip):echo (kubectl get services/hello-minikube -o go-template --template '{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')

# but curl to the ip:32104 is not working
```

### Blockchain

Blockchain has many features which are desirable such as

- Immutability
- Automation
- Decentralisation

App developers can now use Blockchain to create a permanent record of the progress of work in development of an app. Every aspect of the development of the app can be tracked and verified.

Blockchain can also provide levels of encryption which cannot be hacked without the permission of the developer.

Blockchain has a low cost of entry and a relatively high return on investment.

### turn on NAT on the nested Hyper-V VM 
new-vmswitch -name VmNAT -SwitchType Internal
New-NetNat –Name LocalNAT –InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix “192.168.100.0/24”
### assign an IP address to the new internal adapter
### This will be the gateway address for VMs in Hyper-V
get-netadapter "vEthernet (VmNat)" 
    | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.1 -AddressFamily IPv4 -PrefixLength 24
Each nested guest VM needs to have an IP address set and its gateway set as follows:
get-netadapter "Ethernet" 
   | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.2 -DefaultGateway 192.168.100.1

## ADS Alternate Data Streams
embed one file into another
(Windows version of MACOS Forking)
originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.
For instance: the command
“type c:.exe > c:32.exe:anyfile.exe”
will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS “anyfile.exe.”
ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

ADS (hide within another file)
ADS Alternate Data Stream : can 'fork' a file into 2 parts and use this to effectively embed one file into another one
ADS Alternate Data Streams - originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.   For instance: the command   "type c:\anyfile.exe > c:\winnt\system32\calc.exe:anyfile.exe"   will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS "anyfile.exe."    ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

## Bible People

Mark = John Mark = evangelist .... Book of Mark is the first gospel ... Started the church in Egypt ... Martyred in Alexandria AD68 dragged by horses ... Missions with St Paul to Cyprus ... Disappointed Paul in early ministry by not coming on the work .... Paul called him a ‘Son’ later on

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation
Life
        - When does life begin?
            - videos of a baby developing
                - Lila Rose h[ttps://www.facebook.com/watch/lilagracerose/](https://www.facebook.com/watch/lilagracerose/)

        - Christian witchcraft - cursing words from within body of Christ against their own brethren
        - Self witchcraft by own sin or rebellion which is as the sin of witchcraft
Trends
    - Marriage
    - Desensitivity to witchcraft, violence and immorality
    - Christian church
    - Persecution
        - Increase in violent persecution of Christians globally
Judaism

For example we celebrate:

He paid for our sin "Feast of Unleavened bread"

He gave us His Spirit at "Feast of Pentacost."

We shout , blow trumpets and warn  people He is returning soon at "Feast of Trumpets"

We spend a day solely praying to realign our hearts to God/Yahweh ready for our personal judgement at "Feast of Atonement"

We spend 8 days  feasting, partying, dancing, and having joy celebrating Gods 7 day creation , the coming marriage of Christ and the Bride (us the church) and the coming 1000yr reign and new heaven and earth.

Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

git diff HEAD file

# once in the file, navigate with
:return  next line
:space   next page
:q       quit

# check differences before git push
git diff --cached
```

### gitk

gitk - viewing proposed changes

```powershell
# Run gitk and view proposed changes
gitk
```

### GitHub Desktop

Use GitHub Desktop at [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) to visually see all changes first

## Hiding Secrets

Use this guide [https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25) to create a config file with the API keys in it, which is not published to github because it's inside the .gitignore file as well.

### git add

```powershell
# add file to staging area so that files are now tracked
gid add <file>
git add .
git add . --interactive to view changes as you push them

# show differences in files we have just added to the staging area
git diff --cached 

# check differences before commit
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
```

### git reset

```powershell
# before committing, git reset (no full stop) reverses the effect of git add
git reset
```

### git status

```powershell
# show differences between your folder and the staging area
git status
```

### git commit

```powershell
# commit our work as a point in time 'commit' to a local repository
git commit -m "Sample commit"

```

### .gitignore

to add a file to .gitignore which somehow is already being tracked, do the following

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree file
```



## Working With GitHub Online

### git clone

git clone can be used to clone a repository

```powershell
# copy a fresh copy of a remote repository down to the local machine, and initialise it ready for editing
git clone
```

### git remote

```powershell
# validate set up
git remote
# show url set up
git remote -v
git remote get-url --all origin
# set remote url
git remote set-url origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/test-project-3>
# or
git remote add origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/testproject>
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### git push

```powershell
# to see a list of changed files before run git push
git diff --stat --cached origin/master

# see what will happen before you push
git push --dry-run   

# to set up git push one must first define the name of the remote branch to be created
git push --set-upstream origin -branch-name-
# push from local to remote repository
git push
```

### git pull

git pulls remote repo latest changes down into my local repo and merges changes

```
# pull down files from remote to local repository
git pull
```

### git config

git config can be used to configure which github account you are logged into

query user account with

```
git config --global -l    to list and check
```

Set user account details with the following

```
git config --global user.name 'Phil Anderson' 
git config --global user.email 'phil@anderson.com'
```

reset user and begin again

```
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

### git branch

The branches that need to be created are

- Master
- Dev
- Feature Branch

```
# create a branch
git branch branch_name

# create a new sub-branch off dev
git checkout -b new-branch-name dev

# delete a local-only branch 
git checkout master
git branch -D branch_name

# delete a branch if it's been pushed to remote repo also
git checkout master
git branch -d branch_name

# delete the branch you are on, and push this deletion to GitHub also
git push origin --delete branch_name

# delete a remote branch
git checkout master
git push origin --delete remote-branch-name


```

#### rename a branch

```powershell
git checkout old_name
git branch -m new_name
git push origin -u new_name
git push origin --delete old_name
```



### git checkout

```powershell
# move from one branch into another
git checkout branch_name
```

View the files in a particular commit

```powershell
# obtain the ID of the intended commit
git log
# move to this commit and look at the files
git checkout id
```

```powershell
# view all branches including hidden ones
git checkout -a
```

 
### git merge dev

If a dev branch has been updated in github then we need to bring our dev and feature branches into line with the dev branch online.

These steps will pull down and merge all changes.

```powershell
# Create branch dev if it does not exist
git branch dev

# Move to dev branch
git checkout dev

# pull down changes from dev on github to dev on local
git pull origin dev

# check code has pulled down
ls 

// switch to feature branch
git checkout phil-feature-branch-01

// merge changes from dev into this branch
git merge dev
```

## Viewing And Undoing Changes

### git log

git log can be used to view previous commits

```powershell
# view snapshots (commits)
git log

# git log with branching
git log --graph

# git log but summary data only
git log --oneline
```

### git reflog

```powershell
### git reflog

git reflog # display a list of commits with indexes.
```

### git reset —soft

Undo changes and reset the state of the disk back to a given commit point

```powershell
git reset --soft  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git reset —hard

Use this with extreme care as it wipes the files from your hard drive and they become irrecoverable

```powershell
# reset files on your hard disk back to your last commit point
git reset HEAD --hard 

# resets the files on disk to the state registered by this snapshot
git reset --hard  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git clean

Git clean can be used to remove untracked directories, which may still be hanging around and not been deleted properly when a checkout takes place and we no longer want those directories to be present

```powershell
// force removal of untracked directories
git clean -fd
```

### github tagging

GitHub tagging can allow you to commit a project at a certain state in time, and then preserve that state with definite tags in order to be able to recover the project again if needed.

This also works with GitHub releases.

Commits should be finished first, then tagging is done second.

```powershell
# show all tags
git tag
git show

# add a tag
git tag mytag

git tag -a "version-1.0" -m "detailed message about this version" 
git push origin --tags

```

## Other Git Commands

### Fixing a merge conflict

```powershell
# show conflict
git status
```

edit .md file and find `<<<<< ==== and >>>>` markers, edit and remove them

```powershell
# push changes
git push
```

### Change Git User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. You may be denied permissions to push and have to log out of the current user. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Protecting The Master Branch

Once we have created both master and dev branches we should protect the master from direct updates. All updates should now be done via the dev branch. Once updated, then a pull request gets submitted to allow work to be merged from the dev branch into the master branch, after approval.

1. Select master branch
2. Go into master branch settings
3. Choose 'Branches' on the left hand menu
4. Choose 'Add Rule'
5. Tick 'Require Pull Request Before Merging' and type in the name of the branch, ie 'master'
6. The master branch is now protected from direct updates.

### [Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

### Renaming A Branch

```powershell
# if you are on the branch you want to rename
git branch -m new-name
# if you are on another branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
# delete the old local and push the new branch
git push origin :old-name new-name
# point to new upstream branch
git push origin -u new-name
```

## Changing Github User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Tag

```powershell
# list
git tag 
# add 
git tag -a TagName -m "message"
# push
git push origin --tags
```

## SSH

If you have set up SSH keys the commands with `https://` would be changed to

```powershell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:philanderson888/repo.git 
# or
git remote add origin git@github.com:philanderson888/testproject
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### Locating your SSH keys

SSH keys can be located at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or repo, settings, SSH keys 

### Keygen walkthrough

## Github With SSH

with GitBash

```powershell
ssh-keygen
# copy the public key to git respository

#### Risk Analysis Process


    1. IDENTIFY YOUR ASSETS
    
        Equipment of value
        Data ==> OF HIGHEST VALUE EVEN THOUGH
            MAYBE CAN'T PUT PRICE ON IT!
        People 
            Knowledge and Experience of 
            key personnel
        Building
    
       EXAM : AV ==> ASSET VALUE
    
    2. Identify Vulnerabilities / Weaknesses
    
    3. Identify Threats (Internal/External/Man-made/
                Natural)
    
    4. Probability Chart 
    
        % likelihood that a particuar threat
            will materialise and threaten
            a vulnerability
    
            eg 10% chance pothole x in road y
                   will generate an insurance
                   claim
    
        SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY

        ARO ANNUAL RATE OF OCCURRENCE
    
            PREDICTED NUMBER OF TIMES A YEAR
            THIS WILL HAPPEN
    
        ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY
    
            $$$EXPECTED LOSSES IN 1 YEAR				
    
    5. IMPACT ANALYSIS : LOOKING AT COSTS ABOVE OR
        OTHER EVENTS WHICH CAN'T BE MEASURED
        WITH MONEY EG LOSS OF MORALE, MOTIVATION,
        LOSS OF FACE, LOSS OF REPUTATION ETC ...


    6. WHAT DO WE DO??? 
    
        NOTHING  IE LIVE WITH RISK (EG CROSSING ROAD)
    
        INSURE (TRANSFER) OUR RISK BY INSURING
            AGAINST LOSS EG FOOTBALLER INSURE
                    LEG
    
        PUT UP WARNING SIGNS AS DETERRENCE TO 
            ATTACKERS : PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
        
        AVOID THE RISK ALTOGETHER BY DOING SOMETHING
            ELSE (DON'T CROSS THE ROAD BUT USE
                THE TUNNEL!)
    
        SPEND SOME MONEY OR TAKE ACTION
    
            "MITIGATION" => TAKE ACTION TO 
                    MINIMISE OUR LOSS
    
            EG CREATE POLICIES, BUILD DEFENCES,
               EDUCATE USERS, ADVICE FROM EXPERTS,
               TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST
               POTENTIAL ATTACKER





































### Network Security Lab

#### Gaining Access To A Network

##### Class Lab

Spend 20 minutes or so listing and categorising all of the different types of physical and cyber threats to a business.  Be as specific as possible and let the class do the leading and the talking, and if necessary, some research!


#### NTFS And Share Permissions

##### Lab : NTFS and Share Permissions

1. On a server create a share.  
2. In `Active Directory` create two different groups eg `Accounting` and `ITSupport`.  
3. On the share, in the NTFS Security tab, create two folders and grant one access to one group (Accounting) and to the other folder grant access to the IT Support group. 
4. Create some users and place them in the appropriate groups.  
5. Check that the users have the correct access when they log in from a Windows client and try and access the share.






#### Virtual Online Router

https://emulator.tp-link.com/emulator_841hpv5_un/index.htm




#### Group Policy Management

Group policy is the central tool used to control all the Windows clients from the central domain controllers.  Windows uses a `multi-master` model so that the central policies are replicated to all domain controllers, and all Windows clients pick up these policies both at computer startup and also at user login, depending if the policy applies at startup or login.  

We can manage group policies in two ways

1. Local Computer

   Simply run `GPEDIT.msc` from a local computer

2. Server Group Policy Management

   This will affect the whole domain ie every computer joined to this domain, so it's important to know what you are doing!

   Server Manager => Tools => Group Policy Management.  Expand the forest, Domain and  the domain until the `Default Domain Policy` is showing.   If we click on the `Settings` tab in the middle of the page and choose `show all` we can expand and view the existing policy.

   To edit the policy, right click on `Default Domain Policy` and choose `Edit`.  We are now editing the policy.  

##### Lab - Password And Lockout Policy

1. Open Group Policy Editor
2. Find and edit the default domain policy
3. Open Computer, Windows, Security, Account, Password policy and set the following
   - Minimum length 10 characters
   - Expires every 30 days
   - Complex passwords enforced 
   - Minimum age 1 day
4. Open Computer, Windows, Security, Account, Account Lockout policy and set the following
   - 5 incorrect attempts are permitted after which lockout for 10 minutes
   - Reset the incorrect lockout count after 5 minutes

##### Lab - Publish A Printer

1. On the server using Print Management add a printer.  (Can just use the built-in printers on LPT1 port)
2. Share the printer and give it a simple name with no spaces eg `Brother2048`
3. In Group Policy edit the default domain policy then open Preferences, Control Panel, Printers and add a new printer.  Enter the share path to the printer as the path, for example \\<servername>\PrinterSharedName\.

##### Lab - Publish Software

1. Create a share eg C:\Share on Windows and share it as `Share`.
2. Add an msi file to the share for example Firefox from `https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release`  
3. In Group Policy, edit the default domain policy and choose `Computer, Policies, Software, Software Installation` and add a new package.
4. Browse to the `Share path` holding the MSI eg \\\ServerPhil\Share and select the package.  This is now ready for deployment.

#### DNS Labs














### Wireshark

##### Install Wireshark

Install Wireshark and analyse some packets travelling through the network

We can click on a Wireshark session to look at individual packets.  And every packet will have an Ethernet `source` and `destination` address just as per the Ethernet model above.  We can also inspect the payload.

As an interesting lab we can filter for `udp` traffic and then send a PING request to `8.8.8.8` address and look at the Wireshark data.   We can see that actually a PING request to Google (which is `8.8.8.8`) is just sending the alphabet there and back as a payload!  See if you can find it!

### WIFI labs



See ui.linksys.com labs for an example of SSID Broadcast and MAC filtering settings




##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part 1

As an indicator of how careful we have to be with `symmetric` encryption please run the following commands 

```powershell
# show wireless profile names
netsh wlan show profiles
# choose one
netsh wlan show profile name="name-of-wireless-profile" key=clear
```

You should see the WIFI password displayed in plain text.

If you are on a MAC then in the `terminal` please type

```bash
security find-generic-password -wa name-of-wireless-profile
```

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part II

Nobody uses default usernames and passwords these days - do they?

Well it's always worth a check!

Check your WIFI router model then head to `[routerpasswords.com](https://routerpasswords.com)`.  See what you can find!

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part III

For further study please visit `Kali Linux` on your laptop and run `wifite` and follow the trail . . .

### DEFENSE IN DEPTH

       MULTIPLE LAYERS OF SECURITY


#### STORAGE TYPES

DAS DIRECT ATTACHED STORAGE


ANYTHING DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO YOUR COMPUTER

    EG SATA DRIVE / SCSI DRIVE / IDE DRIVE



NAS NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE


NAS DRIVE 

    USE FOR 'SOHO' SMALL-OFFICE HOME-OFFICE

            (LESS THAN 10 USERS)

    USING RAID 5 TO STORE FILES

        
        RAID 0 STRIPING : VERY FAST : BUT
             PROBLEM IF ONE DRIVE FAILS YOU
             LOSE ALL YOUR DATA
        RAID 1 MIRRORING OF 2 DRIVES 
        RAID 5 3+ DRIVES WITH FAULT TOLERANCE : 
            IF ONE DRIVE FAILS THE DATA IS
            ALREADY 'STRIPED' ACROSS OTHER
            DRIVES SO YOUR DATA IS SAFE



SAN STORAGE AREA NETWORK

### MOBILE SECURITY


MOBILE SECURITY IS A 'HOT' ISSUE - WHY???

BYOD : BRING OWN DEVICE : PEOPLE USING PERSONAL DEVICES
    TO GET WORK DONE

    SECURITY RISK WITH COMPANY SENSITIVE INFO ON DEVICE
    WHICH IS 

    A) PERSONALLY OWNED
    B) NOT LOCKED DOWN
    C) NO CONTROL OVER OTHER APPS INSTALLED, IF THEY	
        ARE SNOOPING ETC
    

SOLUTION : ???

    ONE SOLUTION IS TO ONLY PERMIT 'REMOTE-DESKTOP' OR
    CITRIX-STYLE ACCESS WHERE PHONE JUST A 'WINDOW' TO
    REMOTE SERVER, NO DATA STORED ON MOBILE DEVICE

REMOTE LOCK

REMOTE WIPE

ON-BOARDING : HIRE EMPLOYEE : GIVE CORRECT TRAINING
                  POLICIES SIGNED

FIND-MY-DEVICE IF LOST

OFF-BOARDING : WIPE DEVICE SECURELY TO ERASE ALL DATA
        (EMPLOYEE LEAVE ORGANISATION)
















### VIRTUALIZATION


RUNNING ONE OR MORE SERVERS FROM A LARGER 'VIRTUAL HOST'

GOOD

    IF YOU ARE LOW ON CPU, RAM, HARD DRIVE OR 
        NETWORK THROUGHPUT THEN YOU CAN 
        DYNAMICALLY UPGRADE THEM AS YOU NEED				
    CREATE 'SANDBOX' ENVIRONMENT FOR SECURE TESTING
    
    CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SERVER OS/BACKUPS ETC
    IN HANDS OF EXPERTS

    NO LONGER REQUIRE PHYSICAL SPACE TO RUN SERVER
        ROOMS ETC

BAD

2) Turn down POWER!

3) ??? not very good ??? ==>  EXAM : OK ANSWER : DISABLE SSID
                    BROADCAST

    SSID ==> Name of WIFI EG FreeHotelWIFI

    POSSIBLE : DISABLE BROADCAST OF SSID
        
        (( PHONE ==> SEE 'UNNAMED NETWORK'))




### WIFI CHANNELS


WIFI HAS 13 CHANNELS

    BUY DEVICE SET TO CHANNEL 1,6, OR 11

        POOR SIGNAL ==> CHANGE CHANNEL

        HYPERV 	WINDOWS Free

SANDBOX ==> VM FOR TESTING EG VIRUSES : TOTALLY ISOLATED

SNAPSHOT ==> INSTANT BACKUP OF YOUR VM SO CAN RESTORE QUICKLY

VHDX = HARD DRIVE

AVHDX = CHANGES SINCE LAST SNAPSHOT!!!





Problems with VMs


Easy to COPY AND STEAL A WHOLE VM!!!

    VM ESCAPE : Lock VM so it only runs on ONE HOST WHICH
            YOU DESIGNED IT FOR!

VM sprawl : easy to create new VMs which can be unpatched / unmanaged

VM escape : Virus from VM can INFECT HOST
































### AV SCANNING 

VIRUS SCAN : BASED ON VIRUS HASH = SIGNATURE


HOW DOES ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE WORK?

    ALL KNOWN VIRUSES ==> TAKE THEIR 'HASH' THEN
    MATCH ANY FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER WHICH HAVE
    THE SAME HASH ==> THEY ARE A VIRUS!!!

    " SIGNATURE-BASED SCANNING "

OR : ANOMALY-BASED

    MATCHING BEHAVIOUR AGAINST A 'BASELINE' PREDICTED
    GRAPH OF ACTIVITY

OR : BEHAVIOUR-BASED 

    MATCHING AGAINST CERTAIN RULES ==> PRONE TO
    'FALSE POSITIVE'  ((GOOD FILE IDENTIFIED 
                INCORRECTLY AS A VIRUS))

















### NETWORK ATTACKS


ROGUE ACCESS POINT

    WIFI POINT (UNAUTHORISED) SET UP IN YOUR 
    VICINITY AND PEOPLE CONNECT TO IT UNAWARES

EVIL TWIN

    WIFI : WIFI ROUTER WITH SAME NAME AS EXISTING 
        ROUTER

        SSID : BROADCAST NAME OF WIFI HOTSPOT

        EVIL TWIN : SAME SSID

    SOCIAL MEDIA : GET FRIEND REQUEST FROM AN 
            EXISTING CONTACT

    
DRIVE-BY-DOWNLOAD

    JUST VIEW SITE : AUTO-DOWNLOAD STARTS IMMEDIATELY

CLICKJACK

    INNOCENT BUTTON EG 'PLAY VIDEO' ALSO START
                MALICIOUS DOWNLOAD

URL SHORTENING SERVICE

    <HTTP://REALLYREYREALLYREALLYREALLYLONGURL.COM>

    ==> TURN INTO BIT.LY/234SDFR.COM		

    BIT.LY
    GOO.GL

        RECOGNISE THAT A HACKER'S SITE COULD
        BE HIDDEN BY 'SHORT' URL

DOS DENIAL OF SERVICE : FLOOD SERVER WITH TRAFFIC

    PING ATTACK : SMURF ATTACK

    SYN FLOOD

        TCP HAS 3-WAY HANDSHAKE TO SET UP 
            CONNECTION : EXPLOIT THIS
            WITH TCP REQUESTS

P2P : PEER-TO-PEER

    CARE !!! COMPUTER IS VULNERABLE WHEN USING
        TORRENT SITES...CLIENT GETS INVADED
        BY OTHER PEOPLE NEEDING COPIES
        OF FILES

ARP POISON

    ARP -A   shows ARP 'CACHE'

        ARP ==> ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

        CONVERTS ....MAC TO IP

DNS POISON

    CORRUPTING DNS DATABASE
    
    EG SERVERA : HACKER RETURN FAKE IP FOR THIS
            SERVER.  PEOPLE WILL GO 
            TO HACKER'S ADDRESS INSTEAD
            OF REAL SERVER

DNS HIJACK : FULL DNS SERVER BUILT AND SET UP BY ATTACKER
    TO POINT PEOPLE TO THE WRONG SITES









### WIRELESS




ROGUE POINT : FAKE WIFI POINT

EVIL TWIN : WIFI POINT WITH SAME NAME

JAMMING : CAUSING INTERFERENCE SO YOU CAN'T DISCERN
        YOUR GOOD SIGNAL

SNARF = STEAL DATA

BLUESNARF = GETTING DATA STOLEN VIA BLUETOOTH

BLUEJACK = PHONE HIJACKED VIA BLUETOOTH EG INSTALL MALWARE
        
NFC NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION : 5cm range

    CARE : SNOOPING IN NEAR VICINITY (RADIO WAVES)

WAR DRIVING

    LOOKING FOR FREE WIFI

WAR CHALKING

    MARKING ON THE PAVEMENT OR WALL WHERE FREE WIFI
        IS TO BE FOUND, SO OTHERS KNOW ALSO

SHORT PASSWORDS - PROBLEM!!

    1) KEY STRETCH 

    2) SALT 

    PASSWORD + SALT PASSWORD ===> MD5 ==> HASH 
            
    mypass  +   Mon: blue   ==>md5         hash
            Tue: red
            ...

            DATABASE : STORE  HASH OF PASSWORD
                     +    SALT

WHAT 4 THINGS DO WE NEED TO CONNECT TO INTERNET???

    1. IP ADDRESS  
    2. SUBNET MASK 255.255.255.0	
    3. GATEWAY     (YOUR OWN PRIVATE ROUTER ON YOUR LAN)
    4. DNS

GATEWAY = COMPUTER ON OUR LAN THROUGH WHICH ALL INTERNET
        TRAFFIC MUST PASS

SINKHOLE ==> IN WIFI, SETTING UP FAKE GATEWAY SO 
    INTERNET TRAFFIC GOING THROUGH BOGUS GATEWAY

        EG HACK INTO DHCP ==> GET DHCP TO GIVE
            OUT A FAKE GATEWAY ADDRESS

WPS : ONE-BUTTON AUTO-SETUP OF HOME WIFI

    VULNERABILITY : 8-DIGIT PIN NUMBER USED TO SET UP

        BUT IT'S SPLIT INTO TWO 4-DIGIT NUMBERS

           4 6 3 7   |   5 8 3 4

        EACH NUMBER CAN BE HACKED SEPARATELY
        (1 IN 10000 SO EASY TO CRACK)



















### ENCRYPTION 


#### S/MIME


ENABLES MAPPING OF CORRECT PROGRAM TO RUN APPLICATIONS 
    INSIDE BROWSER

        EG PDF : GET CORRECT PDF READER

           MP3 : GET CORRECT PLUG-IN TO PLAY FILE	



#### PGP PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY


EMAIL ENCRYPTION



#### HARDWARE ENCYPTION


HSM HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE

    DEDICATED DEVICE : ENCRYPTION ONLY (STORE
        PRIVATE ENCRYPTION KEYS SECURELY)		



#### NTFS ENCRYPTION


USED BY WINDOWS TO ENCRYPT FILES

LIMITED USE!!!

    CANNOT ENCRYPT
            1) WINDOWS

            2) PAGE FILE = SWAP FILE 
                         = VIRTUAL MEMORY

                SPILL-OVER WHEN RAM 
                GETS FULL			

            3) HIBERNATE 
                
                PUTS RAM CONTENTS TO 
                PERMANENT STORAGE
                AND SHUTS PC DOWN



#### BITLOCKER


PROVIDES FULL DRIVE ENCRYPTION, UNLIKE NTFS

PROBLEM!!!  OUR HARD DRIVES BOOT USING MBR MASTER
        BOOT RECORD TALKING TO BIOS/CMOS
        CHIPS ON OUR COMPUTER

        THESE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT UNDERSTAND 			ENCRYPTION!!!

SO TO GET BITLOCKER TO WORK WE MUST SPLIT OUR HARD DRIVE
        IN TWO

|  100MB   |      REST OF DRIVE			|
   PLAIN	  BITLOCKER ENCRYPTED
   TEXT

TPM CHIP  (TRUSTED PLATFORM MODULE)

    DEDICATED CHIP TO STORE BITLOCKER KEYS 

    
    (( IF NO TPM CHIP IS PRESENT, CAN STORE 
        BITLOCKER KEYS ON USB STICK ))



#### SQL DATA


STANDARD DATABASES STORE DATA IN ROWS AND COLUMNS LIKE EXCEL

    TABLE NAME

        ID	FIELD1	FIELD2

        1	JOE	BLOGGS
        2	JOHN	DOE

    CALLED A 'RELATIONAL' DATABASE = MYSQL/SQL
            
        MYSQL = FREE
        SQL   = PAID (MICROSOFT)
        ORACLE = PAID



#### BIG DATA / NO-SQL


TODAY SO MUCH INFORMATION GETS CREATED AND STORED THAT
TRADITIONAL 'RELATIONAL' DATABASES ARE TOO SLOW...

NEW BREED OF DATABASE - NO-SQL OR 'BIG-DATA' STORAGE

FIELDS LOOK LIKE

        {
            "ID" : "1"
            "NAME" : 'PHIL'	
        }

ISSUES WITH SECURITY : DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY : SECURITY,
    ENCRYPTION, PROTECTING DATA



#### DATA DISPOSAL


MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE RESTORED BY CROOKS IF WE DISPOSE
    OF IT CASUALLY.  STRICT POLICIES EXIST TO 
    ENFORCE CORRECT METHOD OF 'DISPOSING' OF DATA

1. WIPE OUR HARD DRIVE WITH RANDOM DATA 7 TIMES OVER

    (( THINK MUDDY FIELD : DRIVE 100 CARS ROUND 
        FIELD 10 MINUTES : ERASE ORIGINAL 
        TRACKS ))

2. DEGAUSS : TAKE A MAGNET AND WIPE DRIVE

3. PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION EG HAMMER OR PHYSICALLY SHRED DRIVE



#### HARDENING YOUR SERVER


HARDEN SERVER = INCREASE SECURITY

BASELINE = ORIGINAL SETTINGS

    HARDEN ==> CREATE NEW BASELINE FOR HARDENED SERVER

GET BASICS RIGHT

    UPDATES FOR SERVER : ON
    UPDATES FOR AV SOFTWARE : ON
    UPDATES FOR APPLICATIONS : PATCH MANAGEMENT : ON



#### INPUT VALIDATION


STOP 'COMMAND INJECTION' ATTACK   

    FORM  ==>   INJECT CODE EG <script>....code </script>

ERROR / EXCEPTION

    COMPUTER CRASHES : REVEAL SENSITIVE INFO EG
     FILE NAMES AND PATHS ON ROOT SERVER

        ERROR: //c:\\windows\\system32\\thisfile.dll...
             c:\\....to website....

    PROGRAMMER HAS TO 'HANDLE' EXCEPTIONS/ERRORS PROPERLY
        WITHOUT GIVING HACKERS EXTRA INFO

XSS : TRYING TO HACK FROM YOUR SITE TO NEIGHBOURING SITE
    (CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING)

XSRF : LOGGED IN ALREADY SO POSSIBLE POTENTIAL TO HACK 
        GREATER 



### Types of testing


BLACK BOX TESTING : JUST LOOK AT INPUT / OUTPUT ONLY
        (NOT DETAILS OF INSIDE CODING)

WHITE BOX TESTING  : KNOWING CODE INSIDE, TRYING TO 						TO BREAK IT DELIBERATELY

UNIT TESTING : ONE SMALL BLOCK OF CODE

INTEGRATION/SYSTEM TESTING : TESTING THE BIG PICTURE

ALPHA TEST : INITIAL RELEASE TO CHOSEN INDIVIDUALS FOR TESTING
    EG JOURNALISTS, DEDICATED AUDIENCE

BETA TEST : FINAL RELEASE, FREE, SO PEOPLE CAN TEST IT FOR 
        YOU (THEY GET FREE GAME!) 

FUZZ TEST : THROW RANDOM DATA AT APPLICATION : DOES IT
        WITHSTAND AND SURVIVE ???


Black Box		Input/Output ONLY!

White Box		Know code : test to break code of program!

Grey Box		Some knowledge

Alpha 			FIRST EARLY RELEASE

Beta			NEAR TO PERFECT : GIVE AWAY FOR FREE: 
            IRON OUT ALL THE BUGS

Unit			Small piece of code !  Test that only

Integration		Join UNITS together

System			Build final product and test

Regression		Fix bugs BUT RE-TEST PRODUCT SO NEW ERRORS
            ARE NOT INTRODUCED

Fuzz Testing		THROWING RANDOM DATA AT OUR APPLICATION
            TO SEE IF IT CATCHES ALL ERRORS, EVEN
            FROM RANDOM RUBBISH

Validation Testing - high level overview - has original purpose of software been achieved

Verification Testing - have the design specs been met





#### PROXY SERVER


USED IN BIG COMPANIES FOR MANY REASONS : 

1) SECURITY : USING DIFFERENT IP THAN REAL GATEWAY

2) CACHING : SPEED OF DATA : STORE COPIES OF FILES ETC
            ON LOCAL LAN PROXY SERVER. 
            CLIENTS GET FASTER ACCESS

3) FILTERING : WHITELIST (GOOD SITES) /BLACKLIST (BLOCKED
            SITES)

4) USER ACTIVITY : KNOW WHICH USERS ONLINE, HOW LONG, WHICH
            SITES...BILLING PURPOSES...



#### TCP TRUSTED COMPUTING BASE


OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH CAN BE 'HARDENED' OR LOCKED DOWN




#### UTM UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT

BIG PICTURE OF PROTECTING OUR WHOLE NETWORK


















### NETWORKS

HUB		LAYER 1		ELECTRICITY IN, 
                ELECTRICITY OUT (NO
                FILTERING)  
                BAD ==> BROADCASTS!!!!

REPEATER	LAYER 1		EXTEND ETHERNET 100M TO 
                200M OR MORE			
                (( 2-PORT HUB ))


LOAD BALANCER	DOING 'ROUND ROBIN' TO ENABLE MULTIPLE
            SERVERS TO HANDLE MANY REQUESTS

IDS INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM 	: JOB IS TO DETECT
        HACKING ACTIVITY / VIRUS ACTIVITY			

HOST = MACHINE EG SERVER/CLIENT USUALLY 'HOSTING' A
        SERVICE

NODE = ANY DEVICE WHATSOEVER ON OUR NETWORK : IP PHONE,
        ROUTER, FIREWALL...

HIDS = HOST-BASED DETECTION : SOFTWARE ON ONE MACHINE ONLY

NIDS = NETWORK-BASED DETECTION EG ON FIREWALL / GATEWAY
        PROTECTING WHOLE NETWORK

IPS INTRUSION PREVENTION : ABILITY TO DETECT ATTACK BUT ALSO
    TAKE MEASURES TO STOP AN ATTACK...

    HIPS HOST-BASED
    NIPS NETWORK-BASED






### ANTI VIRUS SCANNING 

#### SIGNATURE BASED SCANNING

    FIXED SCANNING TO MATCH 'HASH' OF KNOWN VIRUSES
        (BEST AS GIVES RELIABLE DETECTION)

#### ANOMALY BASED SCANNING 

    LOOKING AT 'BASELINE' GRAPHS OF PREDICTED
    TRAFFIC PATTERNS AGAINST ACTUAL TRAFFIC 
    PATTERNS OVER A NETWORK

#### BEHAVIOUR BASED SCANNING

    PATTERNS IN NETWORK TRAFFIC OR 'RULES' GOVERNING
    EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR : ALERTS IF TRAFFIC BREAKS
    SOME 'EXPECTED RULES'

        ** PRONE TO FALSE POSITIVE **

        FALSE POSITIVE = TAKING A GOOD FILE AND
                MARKING IT AS A VIRUS

#### HEURISTIC SCANNING = REAL-TIME SCANNING



### VPN : VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK


ENCRYPT DATA TRAFFIC IN A 'TUNNEL' ACROSS INTERNET



VPN Concentrator : Allow multiple VPN connections into ONE SERVER

Web Security Gateway = Layer 7 firewall looking at content
of traffic coming into your network


    ==> Deep packet inspection

BIG PICTURE ==> UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT (UTM)



NAC : NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL : PROTECTS OUR NETWORK FROM ...
COMPUTERS DIALING IN WHICH MAYBE HAVE VIRUSES ETC


        ==> CHECK HEALTH AND FORCE NON-COMPLIANT
            COMPUTERS TO COMPLY










# Security Architecture 

## Zones

Network segments with traffic between zones controlled eg with a firewall enforcing ACL rules

## Bastion Host = DMZ 

external internet-facing servers

       often configured as proxies, talking to services inside the LAN
       
### Jump Box

single machine on DMZ from which the admin consoles on the bastion hosts may be reached. Access to the Jump Box is tightly controlled eg by single firewall rule to single IP or small subnet on LAN

Management machines (on the LAN) which connect to the jump box should be denied broad internet access

Blackhole Redirect unused ports to specific part of network that is a dead end


       create VLAN or
       redirect traffic to NULL router interface


DOS attack : normally use ACL but instead can just put all traffic to a blackhole

Sinkhole

Instead of blackhole : deleting all packets

Sinkhole is alternative gateway through which all the traffic redirected can also be analysed


       Goal is to find out source of attack and neutralise it
       
       Martian packet = packet destined for IANA Private or restricted range

       Bogon = unallocated range on the internet (there are none left)
       
       
       


## Hardening

Host Baseline = minimum secure config

Attack surface = what can be attacked


       Interfaces - wired and wireless
       Services
       Ports
       


### Baselining

Baselining checklist

Remove all non-necessary devices
Install OS updates and patches, and application updates etc
Note : test updates etc offline first then use distributed system to update clients
Uninstall all unnecessary network protocols
Uninstall/disable services
Remove / disable unnecessary shares
ACL on all resources
Least Privilege user accounts especially with regards to installing software
Rename local admin and apply strong password
Disable guest accounts
Disable default group accounts
remove everyone group permissions from resources
Install and update AV. Autoscan USB&Email&Downloads
Routers and Switches: Update OS, Firmware, ROMMON = OS in NVRAM

DOS attacks - consider possibility and mitigate or provide backup resources

#### Group Policies

Admin Templates - registry

RSoP - settings can be viewed
       
Security Templates
      
DAC - discretionary NTFS ACL

MAC - mandatory CLASSIFIED ETC - Need to know basis

       Subject can't set or change the MAC level
       
## Endpoint security

       Endpoint = client device
       
       Perimeter security = gateway/firewall/dmz etc (opposite of endpoint)
       

### Port security : restrict access


       disable using management software
       
       MAC filter : hard in practice
       
       MAC limiting : only will register first two MAC addresses then drop the others
       
       MAC flooding : switch could 'fail-open' and become like a hub 
              so attacker easier to sniff
              
       802.1x port based control  (port based NAC = PNAC)
       
              supplicant = client device requesting access
              
              switch = authenticator
              
                      EAPoL EAP over LAN requires password, token or certificate
                      
                      Pass to RADIUS server for authentication
                      
              unauthenticated hosts => go to guest VLAN
              


Extra

Is intrusion primary or secondary

Avoid alter attacker

Preserve evidence















































#  Identities 


## NAC

Health policy : firewall, updates etc

Agent on client

Remediation to bring to good health


       refuse or
       quarantine (if VPN) or
       captive portal (if web app) and from there install fixes
       


Pre-admission Post-admission - is it still compliant?

### NAC Policy


       Time restrictions
       Location restrictions
       Role-based restrictions (user and device)
       Rule-based restrictions
       
       Microsoft NAC
       Cisco CNAC
       TPM NAC 
       
       Context-based authentication 
              Time
              Location
              Frequency : number of logins during a given period
              Rule-based : can have multiple factors involved
       


#### Types of rules


       Anti-Malware
              Signature based = HASH
              Behaviour Based = Deviation from baseline eg high CPU/RAM, high traffic with DOS attack
              Anomaly Based = Patterns beyond the normal eg check packet headers for anything unusual, or traffic patterns
              Heuristic = real time scanning, looking for certain patterns in malware code
       NAC
              Time based
              Location based
              Role based
       


## Identity

enrol = sign up

provision - create new account

captcha - verify genuine user signing up

identity proof for user at sign up

privileged accounts

shared accounts - don't know who did what

rbac role based access control - by job role


### identity by ...

IP address
MAC address
Host name
Machine certificate
App certificate





### nac 

complicance

- wifi
- wired
- protocol
- host
- ip
- ports
- apps








## certificates

### sigcheck verify root certificate valid

tool from sysinternals

```bash
sigcheck -tv 
```

### openssl

### certutil (windows)






## dial in

### RADIUS


       Radius server performs authentication (AD)
       
       Client - 802.1x - wifi or other - RADIUS - AD LDAP AUTHENTCATION BACKEND

       windows NPS
       
       linux FreeRADIUS
       
       uses UDP
       
       encrypts ONLY PASSWORD
       
       
       


### TACACS+


       uses TCP
       
       ENCRYPTS ALL DATA - so more secure than RADIUS


### LDAP (Active Directory)


       LDAP 389 


Defences multiple logon attempts geo-velocity - trying to logon from different placess geographically device fingerprinting - is this the first time this device has been used? if so, use two-factor authentication

### SSO

Federation

open to business partners

provisioning = creating accounts for use with federation


       manual
       auto eg by group membership
       


#### SAML : token-based SSO (security assertion markup language)


       SAML is enterprise controlled


#### OpenID


       sign on with .. google, facebook account etc

       user-centric logon
       
       no sharing of data from eg google to the company using this login
       
       OpenID Connect uses OpenAuth also
       Facebook connect ...
       


#### OpenAuth (Open Authorization)


       site providing sharing of data with site being authenticated
       


Password reset

1. questions
2. secondary verification eg text or email



























## Hacking attempts

Impersonation : pretending to be somebody else.
Use ‘identity proofing’ to mitigate = be sure to identify someone properly online

DNS Spoof pharming = DNS Spoof

Session hijack : mitigate with encryption of session

Replay attack

MITM

MItB

ARP Spoof

       Ettercap lab
       
       DAI Dynamic ARP Inspection : prevent ARP Spoof : drop Ethernet packets that do not have a known sender, recipient and a valid entry in VLAN table


Privilege escalation


       Using FLAW IN APPLICATION TO GAIN ACCESS

       Backdoor = deliberate

       Vertical : go from user to admin rights
       Horizontal : go from one user and gain access as another user


Web hacking

SSLstrip


       tricks user into thinking connection is secure when it's not
       
       Padlock is not showing so user can spot this and know they are
                      being hacked
                      
       HTST can prevent this attack : HTTPS is the ONLY TRANSPORT ALLOWED
                      TO THAT SITE SO HTTP IS NOT AN OPTION, SO AN ATTACKER CANNOT
                      FAKE AN HTTP SESSION
                      


XSS Cross Site Scripting


       Malicious code runs on client browser with same permission level
              as a trusted site
              
       reflected = non-persistent attack : once
       
       stored = persistent attack eg malicious script stored in a blog 
              or user forum
              
       XSS is script from server executed on client
       
              eg GET /cgi-bin/log.cgi?<script>...</script>
       
       Or
       
       could execute a script to create a new DOM page 

       Mitigate with INPUT VALIDATION
       


XSRF : like XSS cross-site scripting but have additional power due to virtue of also being logged in (authenticated to site)


       mitigate by mutual authentication on both sides of the connection
       
       


Cookies


       Retain information about STATE
       
       Cookies are sent WITH THE HTTP REQUEST FROM CLIENT TO SERVER AND BACK
       
       NON-PERSISTENT = SESSION
       
       PERSISTENT
       
       XSS ATTEMPTS TO USE COOKIE ON ANOTHER SITE
       
       SSL COOKIES ARE TRANSMITTED ENCRYPTED BUT STORED PLAIN TEXT


       


XSRF EXPLOIT COOKIES


       can exploit applications which use cookies to authenticate and
              track sessions























CIDR /24 MEANS


REMOTE ACCES


ALLOWING COMPUTER TO DIAL IN TO OUR SERVER (RAS = REMOTE
ACCESS SERVER)

    ADD ROLE ==> ROUTING & REMOTE ACCESS

CLIENT => DIAL IN => RAS SERVER
             (VPN SERVER)

            ==> AUTHENTIATE WITH RADIUS SERVER
                (TALK TO ACTIVE DIRECTORY)

            ==> HEALTH CHECK VIA NAC NETWORK
                ACCESS CONTROL



















## Threat Detection


1. Signature Based

    EVERY BAD VIRUS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT : TAKE IT'S HASH!!!

    SCAN OUR COMPUTER ETC FOR ALL GOOD FILES : IF ANY MATCH
    HASH OF A VIRUS ==> WE ALERT!!!!

2. Anomaly Based 

    'Baseline' graph of GOOD BEHAVIOUR EG CPU, RAM, NETWORK

    ==> VIRUS : OFTEN SHOW AS INCREASED CPU ETC : Trigger
                    an alert

        ==> ANOMALY CHECKS AGAINST A GOOD BASELINE GRAPH!!

3. Behaviour Based  ** NOT SO RELIABLE (FALSE POSITIVES!!)

    Creates RULES : if a virus triggers a rule we get an 
            alert eg a certain process running on 
            our PC

    HEURISTIC = REAL TIME SCANNING   (SLOW PC!)




Detecting attacks


Honeypot  : FAKE LURE : 1) We can get info on them!
            2) They are wasting their time!!!

### Network Attacks And Security


Zero day ==> ATTACK ON BRAND NEW SOFTWARE : BAD GUYS FIND VULNERABILITY
AND EXPLOIT IT BEFORE GOOD GUYS GET TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING

Hardening Your System


Harden = make more secure

    Disable unused services and ports
    Security baseline = preconfigured settings to make your
        machine secure
    MBSA Microsoft Baseline Security Analysis : lets you 
        know if your system is weak!!!

### Forensics



Forensics : Science of criminology : examining a PC as part of
        a crime scene

    DATA VOLATILITY

        VOLATILE DATA IS DATA IN RAM/CACHE WHICH WILL
            DISAPPEAR WHEN TURN PC OFF!!!

        ORDER OF VOLATILITY

            CPU
            RAM
            CACHE (TEMP)
            HARD DRIVE 
            LONG TERM BACKUP

    CHAIN OF CUSTODY
        
        GET PC ==> FIRST IMAGE IT!!!  
        HASH/SIGN IMAGE (MUST HAVE DATE STAMP ALSO)
                (( AWARE OF TIME ZONE))

        CHAIN OF CUSTODY : SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE 
            RESPONSIBLE FOR EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES

On board/off board
    ON BOARD ==> HIRE, NEW EMPLOYEE
    OFF BOARD ==> EXIT ORGANISATION





















TPM : CHIP TO STORE BITLOCKER KEYS

HSM : HARDWARE SECURITY MODULE : CAN STORE ANY KEYS FOR YOUR
        COMPANY (STAND-ALONE DEVICE)

​		

DLP = data loss prevention











































## Network Scanning 
   
               
ATTACK SURFACE ==> SOMETHING IN WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED TO a4 THREAT

HONEYPOT

    DECOY TO DISTRACT ATTACKER 1) THEY ARE DISTRACTED
                   2) WE CAN PERHAPS MONITOR
                      THEM
HONEYNET

    WHOLE NETWORK OF DISTRACTION


### Scanning for vulnerabilities

Enemy may do the following : 

    Footprinting : use common sense methods to try and
            gain info on you.  Using methods
            which may be legal eg public 
            birth/death/marriage records, 
            public accounts records, website info

    Enumerating : Using illegal methods to gain further
              detailed info about you.

              EG  COMPANY : DOING PORT SCANS, 
               HACKING IN AND GETTING NETWORK INFO,
               IP INFO, PORT INFO, SERVER NAME 
               INFO, NAMES OF KEY PEOPLE WHO
    
            Personal level : credit card info,
                security answers to questions

You may do the following

    Vulnerability Scan

    Port scan

    Deep-level test to try and penetrate your network
            eg using ethical hackers etc






### DLP


TWO MEANINGS

    DATA LOSS PREVENTION : DATA TAKEN (STOLEN AND REMOVED)

    DATA LEAK PREVENTION : COPY TAKEN 



FAILSAFE : Industrial chain saw will not work unless thumb and fingers
pressing on two separate buttons

FAILSECURE


POWER GOES OUT : SECURE LOCKED DOOR : REMAIN LOCKED BUT
    IF PERSON TRAPPED INSIDE THEY STILL CAN FORCE
    THE DOOR OPEN AND GET OPEN

    EG SERVER ROOM / SAFE



FAILOPEN


POWER GOES OUT : DOOR SWING WIDE OPEN



RESPONDING TO SECURITY INCIDENTS


IRP : INCIDENT RESPONSE POLICY

    EG PEOPLE TO CONTACT STRAIGHT AWAY
       ACTIONS TO TAKE EG UNPLUG FROM NETWORK
       DESIGNATED PEOPLE TO BE 'IN CHARGE' IN CASE
        OF UNCERTAINTY
       FIRST RESPONDER : EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM



FIGHTING CRIME : FORENSICS


IT IS IMPORTANT IN A COURT OF LAW THAT EVIDENCE IS 
    ADMISSIBLE.  IF NOT, IT CANNOT BE USED
    AGAINST A DEFENDANT	

INVESTIGATING A CRIME

    1. LOOK AT ANYTHING 'VOLATILE'  <<VOLATILITY>>

        TURN OFF ==> INFO DISAPPEARS

        EG  CONTENTS OF RAM OR PAGE FILES ETC

    2. HARD DRIVE : TAKE IMAGE STRAIGHT AWAY

        SIGN/HASH IMAGE 

    3. CREATE A 'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'

        SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR
        EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES



DISASTER RECOVERY


FAULT TOLERANCE = RECOVERY FROM FAULT

    EG RAID 5  :   DRIVE FAILS ==> STILL SURVIVE
       CLUSTER :   SERVER FAILS ==> GO TO SERVERB

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE = ONE THING WHICH, IF IT BREAKS, 
        MAKES YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM FAIL (EG YOUR BRAIN!)

    ROUTER : GATEWAY : TO INTERNET
    SWITCH : CENTRAL POINT OF NETWORK

BCP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN : WRITTEN PLAN FOR ACTIVITY
        IN CERTAIN EVENTS EG WEBSITE GETS HACKED.

BIA BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS : WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THREAT
        X MATERIALIZES (IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS)

MTD MAX TOLERABLE DOWNTIME

    EG IF SERVER GOES DOWN, IT MUST BE UP WITHIN 2 DAYS	

RPO : RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

    HOW FREQUENT ARE YOUR BACKUPS???
    IF DISASTER, HOW MUCH DATA ARE YOUR PREPARED TO LOSE?
    EG EVERY 4 HOURS YOU BACKUP, THEN POTENTIALLY
    ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE 4 HOURS WORTH OF DATA?

RTO RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE : PLANNED TIME BY WHICH WE 
    HAVE FIXED AN ITEM AND GET EVERYTHING WORKING



HOT/WARM/COLD SITE


HOT SITE : 100% READY TO GO - COMPUTERS, NETWORK

        *** TOO COSTLY ! ***

WARM SITE : PCS THERE, SHUT DOWN.  1-2 DAYS TO GET SET 
    UP, RESTORE BACKUPS, BEGIN WORK.

        *** HIGH BUT REASONABLE COST **

COLD SITE : JUST BARE SHELL OF BUILDING WITH WATER AND
        ELECTRICITY AND LITTLE ELSE

    1-2 WEEKS TO SET UP



MTTF MEAN TIME TO FAIL = AVERAGE TIME BEFORE EG HARD DRIVE FAIL (3 YEARS)


==> MTBF MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES



MTTR MEAN TIME TO REPAIR : AVERAGE TIME TO FIX EG SERVER

Server

1. RENAME
FIX SERVER IP
2. DCPROMO : BUILD DOMAIN phil.local (COMPANY)
3. DNS ON CLIENT : POINT TO SERVER IP
4. JOIN CLIENT TO DOMAIN









































### Advanced Malware Attacks

Ping flood	Flooding a server with PING REQUESTS
ICMP flood
PING = ICMP

Smurf Attack	Malformed PING : DISGUISE SOURCE IP

TCP SYN Flood
TCP : Always send a '3-WAY HANDSHAKE' to set up
1) Hello : I'm going to send you data 2) Server : OK 3) Client : Done


SYN FLOOD : Send lots of 'hello' (stage 1) requests ONLY
    Server : reserve space for conversations which never happen



Flood guard : watches for and prevents flood attacks (DOS flood)

Port Scan	Scanning network for all OPEN PORTS (free online port scan)	*** NOTE : THIS IS SEEN AS AN ATTACK **

XMAS Attack	Port Scan ==> ALL OF THE POSSIBLE 'FLAGS' SET TO 'HIGH' (1)
TO PROVOKE A RESPONSE

MITM Man In The Middle


Client			Bad Router 		Server

        Can be used 
        1) Eavesdrop : LISTEN (Passive)
        2) Alter packets in some way
                (Active)

Prevent : HTTPS Scanning (part of UTM Threat Management)



Session Hijack


Client---------------Bad Router----------------Server

    Bad router can actually 'take over' session

             Bad Router----------------Server

    Server THINKS STILL TALKING TO CLIENT BUT IS NOT: 
        BAD ROUTER IS IMPERSONATING AND HAS TAKEN
        OVER THE SESSION



Session Replay Attack


Valid session is copied and played back later

Client---------------Bad Router---------------Server

    later on Bad Router 'replay' same packets back to server
    to create a 'dummy' connection.

Mitigate using TIMESTAMPS



Passord Attack

​    STOP : using Account Lockout Policy

Birthday attack
TWO FILES CAN HAVE SAME HASH : USE THIS TO GET PAST OUR 'HASHING'	PROOF THAT A FILE HAS NOT CHANGED



DNS Map NAME to IP

DNS Poison : FAKE DNS Records

DNS Pharming attack : FAKE DNS SERVER or CORRUPT 'HOSTS' RECORD ON ONE PC
Hosts ==> NOT USED NOW!!!
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

ARP	Address Resolution Protocol	IP to MAC conversion
arp -a

ARP Poison
Fake/change some ARP data to cause trouble

Typo Squatting


    Gooogle.com
    Amazone.com     MIS-SPELLING OF COMMON SITES : PEOPLE BUY
            DOMAIN NAME THEN SELL TO CORRECT OWNER FOR
            LOTS OF MONEY



URL Hijacking
Buy domain names of companies and 'sit on them'. Force
legitimate company to pay us lots of money to sell them
back their own domain name

Watering Hole	Attacks on sites which are very popular and lots of people
hanging around eg social media sites

Zero Day	Brand new software : Hackers discover weakness : exploit it
before good guys get a fix

Cookie	Text file : tracking your browsing

LSO Flash Cookie DON'T USE FLASH ! But in the exam!!!
Flash Cookie = LSO Locally Shared Object

Errors	Programmer error ==> get wrong answer!!! (eg Interest Rate
is wrong)

Exceptions	SYSTEM CRASH!!!!
Handled : sorted internally
Unhandled : PROGRAM CRASHES!!

Application Attack
Main APPLICATIONS we are concerned with are
1) HTTP/HTTPS WEB SERVER!!!
LINUX : FREE 'APACHE' WEBSITE
WINDOWS : FREE : IIS INTERNET INFORMATION
SERVICES
2) DATABASE SERVER
3) EXCHANGE EMAIL ETC

Injection Attacks


Website : FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION
      eg
        name..........  dob........  
        address.........

                SUBMIT

It's possible to INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING TEXT, SUBMIT CODE INSTEAD!!!
    
SQL
    REGULAR SQL : SELECT * FROM USERS ...

    FORM : Instead of submitting name, submit SQL code instead.
    
LDAP	
XML



Input Validation


Check for 'strange' characters like \\ / < > ' "   etc in fields



Buffer Overflow Attack


Buffer 
    Temporary data store to hold information when network
    is slow : waiting for data to either send or receive

    Buffer data is stored in RAM of COMPUTER!

    Buffer Overflow attack ==> PUSH GOOD DATA OUT OF BUFFER,
        POSSIBLY GET ACCESS TO AREAS OF RAM NEXT TO 
        THE BUFFER WHICH NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO



XSS Cross Site Scripting


Hack in to one website and from there, hack into another	



Folder Traversal Attack


Reach one folder : from there, navigate and reach another folder



XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery


Hack a website but ALREADY LOGGED IN ==> YOU HAVE MORE POWER
    TO DO MORE DAMAGE WHEN YOU HACK IN





#### CODE INJECTION ATTACK = APPLICATION ATTACK


CODE INJECTION ATTACK : CAN PUT <script>....code..</script>

    INTO A WEB FORM WHERE REGULAR TEXT IS EXPECTED

### XSS CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

    INJECTED CODE ATTEMPTS TO AFFECT OTHER SITES
    WHICH MAY BE 'HOSTED' ON SAME WEB SERVER


#### XSRF CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

    USER IS LOGGED IN ALREADY SO THIS CODE INJECTION
    PERHAPS HAS GREATER PERMISSIONS TO DO DAMAGE



    HOT FIX		SHORT-TERM FIX TO ISSUE	
    PATCH		FIX TO A FAULT
    UPDATE		IMPROVEMENT
    SERVICE PACK	CUMULATIVE PREVIOUS UPDATES IN ONE

#### BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK

    RAM (MEMORY) 
    
        SECURE RAM   |   BUFFER = SHORT TERM STORAGE
                 |		 AREA EG FOR HARD 
                         DRIVE
    
    BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK TRIES TO PUT SO MUCH DATA
        IN BUFFER, ATTACKING CODE REACHES SECURE
        AREA OF RAM

#### INJECTION TYPES
        SQL (DATABASE)
        XML (TEXT DATABASE)
        LDAP (ACTIVE DIRECTORY)



PORT


1.2.3.4 : 80

IP      : PORT

<--socket----->  		SOCKET = IP:PORT

WHAT IS A PORT???

    IT IS A CHANNEL BY WHICH DATA GETS SENT TO IP
        ADDRESS
    
        PICTURE : YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE OF 65000
            MAILBOXES IN ORDER TO GET 
            YOUR MAIL THROUGH!!!
    
        NOTE : HTTP ALWAYS PORT 80, HTTPS ALWAYS 443
    
    PORT 1-1000 ARE PRE-RESERVED FOR INTERNET USE
         1000+ CAN BE CONFIGURED BY USER
            EG GAMERS : SET PORT FORWARDING
                ON YOUR ROUTER SO GAMING
                TRAFFIC REACHES EG XBOX
    
    65536 VALID PORTS


​	
PORT SCAN

    *** POSSIBLY COULD BE SEEN AS A HACKING TOOL **
    
    USED TO SCAN ALL PORTS ON IP ADDRESS TO SEE WHICH
    ONES ARE OPEN, OFTEN WITH A VIEW TO THEN HACKING
    INTO THAT ORGANISATION
    
    <http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx>
    
        EG cfa.org

XMAS DAY ATTACK

    DOING A PORT SCAN WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE FLAGS				SET TO 'ON' TO TRY AND TRIGGER A RESPONSE FROM
    EACH PORT


#### EAVESDROPPING

LISTENING IN TO TRAFFIC OR SIGNALS

    WIRESHARK OR NETMON

#### MAN-IN-MIDDLE ATTACK

    client -----------router-----------------server
    
            ROUTER OWNED
            BY HACKER : 
            CAPTURING AND
            VIEWING TRAFFIC	
            [[ POSSIBLY COULD
            TRY TO MODIFY
            TRAFFIC ALSO]]

#### SESSION HIJACKING

    client --------------router-----------------server
    
        ROUTER IN MIDDLE TOTALLY TAKES OVER
        THE SESSION, PRETENDING TO BE ONE
        OF THE MACHINES
    
    client---------------router
    
        SESSION HIJACKED - CLIENT THINKS IT IS 		
        TALKING TO SERVER BUT IS NOT!

#### SESSION REPLAY

    9AM:
    
    client ------------router -----------------server
    
            MALICIOUS 
            ROUTER WILL
            COPY ALL TRAFFIC
            THEN REPLAY IT 
            ALL BACK LATER
            PRETENDING TO BE
            ONE OF THE MACHINES		
    
    10AM
    
            router -----------------server
    
            ROUTER IS PRETENDING
            TO BE CLIENT TO 
            GAIN ACCESS TO SERVER
    
    PREVENT BY EG TCP SEQUENCE NUMBER, TIMESTAMP ETC

Network models

```
Domain

    Central Server “DOMAIN CONTROLLER” (DC)

        Windows ==> Active Directory creates domain

    Multimaster model : each DC has full rights to update
            domain database e.g. new user, group etc

    PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP

Client/Server

        Temporary e.g. online banking

Workgroup

        DEFAULT ==> no server at all, just clients on network

Peer-to-peer

    COMMON TO SHARE WORKLOAD

        e.g.  WINDOWS UPDATES ==> DOWNLOADED TO WIN10 
        BUT SHARED WITH PEOPLE A) LAN B) INTERNET	
        ((Old days ==> ONE CENTRAL SERVER, GET FILES FROM
                    SERVER EG WITH FTP (FILE TRANSFER 											PROTOCOL)
        Peer-to-peer : CHOP FILE INTO SEEDS.  DOWNLOAD
                SEEDS.   CAN SHARE SEEDS WITH OTHERS.

```

LAN
Client ==> Switch ==> Router ==> ((Modem))

WAN

```
Client => Switch => Router => Modem —————dial up———

                ISP Router ———> INTERNET

```

WAN with VPN

```
                            encrypted tunnel
LAN1==> Router1==================Router2 => LAN2

        All machines on LAN1 share same GATEWAY which
            is Router1.   They connect through this to LAN2

```

PAN
Personal Area Network

```
    BLUETOOTH : DIRECT CONNECTION

            EG PRINT TO PRINTER OVER BLUETOOTH

            ((TODAY WIFI DIRECT ALSO DOES THIS))

```

MAN
Metropolitan : city-wide e.g. Hospital/Bank/University

```
            ((usually. FIBER OPTIC))

```

LAN COMPONENTS

```
Hub

7 Layer Model Of Networking

```
Used 1) Theory 2) Real world

1. 	Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Layer 1 : Physical
    
        ANYTHING YOU CAN TOUCH

        CABLING
                        COPPER
                                    COAX
                                    ETHERNET
                        FIBER
        PORTS
        

Layer 2 : Data Link

        DEALS WITH GETTING DATA ROUND OUR LAN

            USE UNIQUE ETHERNET ADDRESS
                                  (MAC address)
                                (Physical address)

                                IPCONFIG ==> SHOW IP address
                                IPCONFIG /ALL.  ==> SHOW MAC address

        MAC address IS UNIQUE ON LAN

                TWO PARTS

                1ST HALF : OUI : NAME OF COMPANY WHICH BUILT 
                                                             CARD
                                ((OUI  organisationally unique id))

                2nd HALF : UNIQUE ID SO FULL MAC address IS
                                    UNIQUE

        SWITCH

                Inspect ‘to’ address of ETHERNET ‘FRAME’

        ETHERNET FRAME

                Preamble : notification that data is following
                To : 
                From:
                Data :   1500 bytes max
                CRC. : 	Error check (( check data not lost in transit)

        SWITCH : INSPECT ‘TO’ ADDRESS

                create SWITCHING TABLE

                PHYSICAL			MAC 
                PORT

                1							AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF
                2							….

            Data arrives : check ‘to’ address and see if there is a match
                    in switching table

                    IF MATCH : SEND OUT ON THAT PORT
                    IF NO MATCH : BROADCAST ON ALL PORTS

                                        ((ETHERNET : FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
                                             All one’s broadcast address))

Layer 3 : Network Layer

        Layer 1 ; cabling etc
        Layer 2 : LOCAL LAN ONLY
        Layer 3 : IP CAN TALK TO GLOBAL INTERNET

                Public

                            (( our address ==> WHATISMYIP ))
                                ((THIS IS OUR LAN ROUTER == GATEWAY ))
                Private
                        4 ranges

Layer 3 : ROUTING

        ROUTING DOES TWO THINGS
    
            1) CREATE FAST ROUTES (CHANNELS) FOR DATA TO 
                                                               FLOW
                        ((Think : build road infrastructure in a country))	

            2) SEND DATA

        ROUTING PROTOCOL

                SOFTWARE WORKING ON ROUTERS

                ENABLE ONE ROUTER TO TALK WITH ANOTHER
                        ROUTER AND SHARE ‘BEST ROUTES’

                EG 
                    RIP
                    EIGRP
                    OSPF
                    BGP

                A) RIP : Routing Internet Protocol

                        RIPV2. Is in use now
                        Uses ‘HOPS’ to measure distance

                                ((Look at.  PING/ PATHPING / TRACERT))

                                                                  ((TRACEROUTE LINUX))
                
                            HOP COUNT == ‘METRIC’.  (MEASUREMENT 
                                            OF DISTANCE ACROSS INTERNET)

                    RIP : BAD POINTS : EVERY 30 SECONDS IT WILL
                            BROADCAST TO ALL ROUTERS ITS FULL
                            ROUTING TABLE!!!!    Creating NOISE!!!

                2). EIGRP.    ((Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing 
                                            Protocol))		
                            CISCO
                                        HOPS FOR DISTANCE											DATA SENT 1-1 UNICAST
                                        ONLY CHANGES SENT
                

                3) OSPF. Open Shortest Path First

                        SPLIT WORLD INTO ‘AREAS’
        
                            ((think paper letter : to S.America=> Brazil => 
                                        Sao Paulo => District => Street => 5))

                    EVERY COMPANY GETS GLOBAL ID : SEND DATA TO 
                    THIS ID AND INTERNALLY COMPANY CREATE 
                    AREAS TO GET DATA TO FINAL DESTINATION

            4)   BGP BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL : BACKBONE (
                        Fast Internet )

    Layer 4 : Transport Layer

            Layer 1 : Cabling
            Layer 2 : Local Network
            Layer 3 : Global IP

            Layer 3 lacks CHECKING THAT DATA HAS ARRIVED

            Layer 4 provides two fields 

                1) SEQUENCE NUMBER : 1,2,3,4,5,… COUNT PACKETS
                                                                                OUT
                2) ACK (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) 1,2,3,4,5.  RECEIVER 
                                CAN LET SENDER KNOW DATA ARRIVED

                SEND 5 PACKETS : SEQ 1,2,3,4,5 
                RECEIVER : ACK 1,2,4,5
                SENDER : PACKET 3 MISSING : RESEND 3
                RECEIVER : ACK 3

        TCP : 3-WAY HANDSHAKE TO BEGIN
                1) Sender : are you ready?  2) Receiver : yes 3) Sender : 
                                                          Let’s begin

                TCP : SLOW!!!

        UDP : CAN BE USED IF NO CHECKING NEEDED

                User Datagram Protocol

                FAST BUT NO CHECKING : USEFUL EG 
                                        YOUTUBE/STREAMING

        TCP : CHECK (SLOW)
        UDP : FAST BUT NO CHECK

    Layer 5 : Session

        CREATES ‘FLOW/STREAM OF DATA TO/FROM COMPUTER’

        EG. 5 tabs in browser: each playing same Youtube video

                ==> SESSION LAYER SORT STREAMS

     Layer 6 : Presentation

            1) ENCRYPTION

            2) COMPRESSION

                    e.g. WAV audio => compress to MP3
                           RAW/BMP image ==> compress to JPG
                            WMV         ==> MP4

        Layer 7 : Application Layer

                PROGRAM EG OUTLOOK WHICH REQUESTS ACCESS 									TO NETWORK

```

Switching Table

```
View on PC

Packet Switch vs Circuit Switch

    Circuit switch

                (phone line)

            no choice!!!

        Circuit switched path ==> fixed path, signal has no choice				
        Virtual circuit eg during phone call : create it but then
            fix it for that call.  

            PVC permanent
            SCV switched temporary  (inside switch)

    Packet switch

        Each router is INDEPENDENT

            Each IP packet makes OWN WAY TO DESTINATION

        No fixed route!!!

    
Carrying data quickly inside eg BT

    Old	
        1) X25		BAD ANSWER LIKE HUB/WEP

        2) Frame Relay	

                UniqueID for routes   DLCI Data Link Connection
                                ID

        3) MPLS  currently  Multi Protocol Layer Switch

        ===> THESE GIVE CIR Commited Info Rate ie guaranteed speed

NETWORK COMPONENTS

HUB

```
FIRST EVER NETWORKS CREATED USED HUBS

PURELY FORWARD ELECTICITY ARRIVING AT ONE PORT, 
SEND OUT SAME PULSES ON ALL OTHER PORTS

---->IN---HUB===> OUT (SAME SIGNAL)

THIS WAS GOOD FOR SMALL NETWORKS.

TODAY HUBS ARE TERRIBLE.

    BECAUSE ==> BROADCAST TRAFFIC TO ALL DEVICES ALWAYS

        CREATE 'NOISE' ON NETWORK

    ((UNICAST = 1-1))
    ((BROADCAST = 1 TO MANY))		

SPEED OF HUB = 10Mbps

BUT DECREASES WITH N DEVICES TO 1/N SPEED

10 DEVICES ==> 1/10 SPEED (AT BEST)

```

BRIDGE

```
OLD, WAS USED TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORKS

    EG TOKEN RING FROM IBM TO ETHERNET

    (WORKS AT LAYER 2)

```

REPEATER

```
LIKE HUB 

ONLY GOT 2 PORTS 

JUST USED TO EXTEND LENGTH OF A NETWORK

EG

ETHERNET 100M MAX LENGTH

    100M : REPEATER : 100M 

    -----200m total-------

    
5-4-3 rule : 5 NETWORKS WITH 4 REPEATERS BUT ONLY 3 CAN 
        HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEM!

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10 MBPS  : USED THICK COAX CABLE CALLED 'THICKNET'  

THEN

10 MBPS  : THINNET (STILL COAX) - LIKE TV CABLE TODAY

THEN

ETHERNET : 10/100/1000/10000 MBPS TODAY!!!

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
USED BY STUDENTS AND REAL-WORLD ENGINEERS!

LAYER 1 PHYSICAL

    SENDING OUT ELECTICAL PULSES

    WIRE : COPPER OR FIBER

    WIFI : WIFI SIGNAL

    ENCODE : SEND DATA OUT IN FORMAT SO IT CAN 
        GET FROM A TO B WITHOUT LOSING 
        DEFINITION OF SIGNAL

    PHYSICAL NETWORK PORT

LAYER 2 DATA LINK

    LOCAL LAN TRAFFIC

    EACH DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE ADDRESS CALLED A 'MAC
    ADDRESS'

        MAC = MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

    EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE

        2 PARTS : COMPANY ID + UNIQUE PART

              (( OUI ))

    VIEW MAC ADDRESS ==> IPCONFIG /ALL

LAYER 3 NETWORK

    LAYER 1  : PHYSICAL
    LAYER 2  : LOCAL ADDRESSES (LAN ONLY)

    LAYER 3  : GLOBAL ADDRESSING SCHEME VALID ACROSS
           ENTIRE WORLD : UNIQUE ADDRESSES IDENTIFY
           COMPUTERS

           EG GOOGLE SERVER AT 173.194.116.193

```

LAYER 2 : LAN ADDRESS : MAC ADDRESS : PHYSICAL ADDRESS : ETHERNET PROTOCOL

LAYER 3 : GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

```
MAC ADDRESS : VALID ON LAN ONLY

IP ADDRESS : VALID GLOBALLY (IF YOU PAY FOR ONE!) 

    PRIVATE IP : FREE, INTERNAL USE

        10.X.Y.Z, 172.16-172.31.Y.Z , 192.168.X.Y

        (( APIPA   169.254.X.Y  ==> DHCP NOT WORKING))

    ROUTERS ALSO WORK HERE

        TALK TO OTHER ROUTERS : CREATE PATHS
        ACROSS THE WORLD FOR FASTEST WAY TO GET
        DATA FROM A TO B

        CREATE 'ROUTING TABLE' OF BEST ROUTES

        DATA COMES IN ==> DATA SENT DOWN BEST ROUTE

```

ROUTING PROTOCOLS

```
ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER.  THEY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
    ROUTES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT.  THEY USE THIS TO 
    BUILD 'BEST ROUTES' ROUND THE INTERNET

ROUTING PROTOCOL IS A LANGUAGE THAT ROUTERS USE TO TALK 
    TO EACH OTHER

RIP   ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL

    OLDEST PROTOCOL

    'BROADCAST' BASED ==> WHOLE ROUTING TABLE GETS
    SENT OUT TO ALL ROUTERS EVERY 30 SECONDS	

    (EVEN IF NO CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE)

METRIC = WAY TO MEASURE STUFF

    MEASURES DISTANCE IN 'HOPS'

    ONE HOP = ONE ROUTER 'BOUNCE' ALONG THE WAY

    BEST ROUTES CHOSEN WITH LOWEST 'HOP' COUNT

EIGRP

    CISCO : SIMILAR BUT FASTER AND ONLY SEND OUT DATA
    IF CHANGES ARE PRESENT

OSPF

    DIVIDES THE WORLD INTO 'AREAS' LIKE CONTINENTS AND
    COUNTRIES.  SEND DATA TO AN AREA, THEN SUB-AREA ETC

    AUSTRALASIA => AUSTRALIA => WEST => MELBOURNE 
        ==> STREET => HOUSE NUMBER

BGP
    BACKBONE OF INTERNET (FAST)
    
    
    
    
    
    
LAYER 4 TRANSPORT

    LAYER 3 : IP PACKETS  BUT PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT

        - LIKE A REGULAR POSTMAN - THERE IS NO 
            RECORD OF DELIVERY 

        "CONNECTIONLESS" 

    LAYER 4 : TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

        - COUNT AND CHECK ALL PACKETS IN AND OUT

        ==> SENDING : OUT : USE A 'SEQ' SEQUENCE NUMBER

        ==> CONFIRMING RECEIPT : USE AN 'ACK'
                ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER

            SEND : SEQ : 3,4,5,6,7
                   ACK : 3,4,6, 7

            ACK PACKETS SENT BACK TO ORIGINAL 
            SENDER.  SENDER FLAGGED THAT PACKET
            5 HAS GONE MISSING

            PACKET 5 RESENT!!!

        " BETTER SLOW DATA THAN NO DATA "

            TCP IS SLOWER BUT PEACE OF MIND
            DATA IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING

        TCP : CHECKS

        UDP : USED WHERE NO CHECKING REQUIRED

            (BLANK, DUMMY PROTOCOL)

            UDP ==> VERY FAST!!
        
            EG STREAMING RADIO STATION

LAYER 5 SESSION

    CREATES AND MANAGES 'SESSIONS' OR 'STREAMS OF TRAFFIC'

    EG SKYPE + EMAIL + TEXT CHAT + BROWSE INTERNET : ALL
        TRAFFIC GETS PUT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION

    EG MULTIPLE TABS ON A BROWSER

LAYER 6 PRESENTATION

    COMPRESS DATA

        EG WAV (UNCOMPRESSED) ==> MP3/WEBM
    
    ENCRYPT DATA

LAYER 7 APPLICATION

    PROGRAM WHICH IS REQUESTING ACCESS TO NETWORK
    EG OUTLOOK OR SKYPE ETC

```

SWITCHES

```
LAYER 2 DEVICE

FILTER ALL TRAFFIC USING 'MAC ADDRESS' OF EVERY DEVICE
    ATTACHED

BUILD UP A 'SWITCHING TABLE' OF ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

PORT		MAC ADDRESS

1		30-85-A9-9A-6B-B5
2		00-50-56-C0-00-01
3		00-50-56-C0-00-08

ETHERNET PACKET GETS SENT FROM A DEVICE TO SWITCH

|-----data--------------|SOURCE MAC |  DESTINATION MAC |
                       00-50-56-C0-00-08

            |---------header---------------|

    ==> SWITCH CHECKS TABLE AND IN THIS INSTANCE
        FINDS A MATCH ON PORT 3 SO WILL FORWARD

NETWORKING : TCP/IP

```
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TCP/IP???

    COLD WAR : RUSSIA VS US

    GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK WITH FOLLOWING
        CHARACTERISTICS

    1) NODES WERE INDEPENDENT AND NOT CENTRALLY MANAGED

    2) TRAFFIC GETS FROM A TO B WITH ROUTING AGAIN 
        NOT DICTACTED CENTRALLY BUT LOCAL 
        ROUTING DECISIONS TAKEN 'AUTONOMOUSLY'

    GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT COULD
    AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE A NUCLEAR WAR WITH WHOLE 
    CITIES GOING OUT.  NETWORK WOULD SURVIVE AND RE-ROUTE
    ON SURVIVING NODES

ROUTABLE PROTOCOL : CAN SEND DATA ROUND WORLD

    NON-ROUTABLE PROTOCOLS ARE LOCAL LAN ONLY

        EG 

            ETHERNET
            NETBIOS   (USES HOST NAME ONLY)
            APPLETALK

BINARY NUMBERING

BINARY HAS ONLY 1 OR 0 FOR ALL NUMBERS

BINARY COLUMNS

        32	16	8	4	2	1		

DECIMAL 12      0        0      1       1	0	0

DECIMAL 30	0	1	1	1	1	0

IP ADDRESS  (32 BITS LONG)

    10	.	11	.	12	. 	13

    
  00001010	     00001011        00001100       00001101 

SUBNET MASK

    SPLIT IP ADDRESS INTO 2 PARTS

    LEFT : NETWORK ID  (SAME FOR ALL COMPUTERS)

    RIGHT : HOST (UNIQUE PC ID)

    EXAMPLE : MOST COMMON MASK = 'CLASS C'

       255	.	255	.	255	.	0
   11111111	     11111111       11111111       00000000

STANDARD IP (SAME AS ON MOST NETWORKS)

IP      192	.	168	.	1	.     22
MASK    255 	.	255	.	255	.     0

                        ^
                        ^
                         SPLIT POINT

SPLIT POINT CREATES 

    LEFT : NETWORK ID IS NOW 192.168.1

    RIGHT : HOST PC ID IS NOW  22

GATEWAY IS ROUTER TO INTERNET : ALL TRAFFIC THROUGH THIS 
    COMPUTER.  NORMALLY GATEWAY = FIREWALL = SECURITY
    DEVICE ALSO.

CLASS A/B/C NETWORKS

    CLASS A HAS MASK  255.0.0.0
    CLASS B HAS MASK  255.255.0.0
    CLASS C HAS MASK  255.255.255.0

CLASS A/B/C/D/E ADDRESSES !!!

    EXAM !!!

    TO DETERMINE CLASS OF IP YOU MUST LOOK AT THE 
    FIRST NUMBER ONLY!!!

    EG 10.11.12.13  ONLY NUMBER WE LOOK AT IS THE '10'

CLASS   A	FIRST DIGIT IS IN RANGE 1 TO 126
    LOOPBACK	127.0.0.1
    B	128-191
    C	192-223
    D	224-239		MULTICAST RANGE
    E	240-254

CLASS A

    FIRST DIGIT IN RANGE 1-126

LOOPBACK ADDRESS
    
    127.0.0.1
    ::1

    ADDRESS FOR OUR OWN LOCAL MACHINE ((LOCALHOST))

        PING 127.0.0.1 ==> PING OWN COMPUTER TO
            TEST  NETWORKING IS TURNED ON

        PING LOCALHOST

        PING ::1    IPV6 

CLASS B

    FIRST DIGIT 128-191

CLASS C	

    FIRST DIGIT 192-223

CLASS D

    FIRST DIGIT 224-239

CLASS E

    FIRST DIGIT 240-255

((( IN PASSING, NOTE THAT A BROADCAST ADDRESS IS SET TO 
    "ALL 1'S"  IE  SEND TO 

    11111111  11111111  11111111  11111111  )))

CLASS A ADDRESS 1-127

    BINARY

        FIRST 7 DIGITS

        8TH DIGIT FIXED ZERO

        0XXX XXXX

        EG 30 IS 00011110
               127 IS 01111111

CLASS B HAS 10 AS FIRST TWO DIGITS

        10XX XXXX

        SMALLEST NUMBER

        1000 0000 = 128
        
        BIGGEST NUMBER

        1011 1111  = 191

CLASS C HAS 110 AS FIRST 3 DIGITS

        110X XXXX

        SMALLEST  1100 0000 = 192
        HIGHEST   1101 1111 = 223

CLASS D		1110 XXXX
        SMALL  	  1110 0000 = 224
        HIGH	  1110 1111 = 239

CIDR

    WITH THE SUBNET MASK WE CAN WRITE IT THUS:

    255.255.255.0   WHICH MEANS THAT THE SPLIT
            POINT IS CREATED AFTER  HOW 
            MANY BITS???? 8+8+8=24 BITS

    THEREFORE CAN WRITE THE SAME THING AS /24

    CIDR NOTATION IS 1.2.3.4/24 MEANS 255.255.255.0

    CLASS A => 255.0.0.0 ==> /8
          B                  /16
          C                  /24

    CLIENT : REQUEST TO RENEW

            
BOOTP WAS PRIMITIVE FORERUNNER TO DHCP 

    BOOTP = DHCP

DHCP RELAY AGENT : DHCP SERVER : TO AVOID PUTTING ONE SERVER
    FOR EVERY SWITCH, YOU CAN SET YOUR ROUTERS TO FORWARD
    DHCP REQUESTS TO THE ONE DHCP SERVER ON YOUR LAN

HASHING

    ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION

    TEXT STRING   ==> ALGORIGTHM ==>   ZK3FLKJPOIDFCFLKJ

    1) ONE-WAY : MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN YOU CAN'T REVERSE
        GET BACK TO ORIGINAL TEXT	

    2) HASHES ALL SAME LENGTH

    
    3) CHANGE ONE CHARACTER : HASH CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

TWO WAYS TODAY TO PRODUCE HASHES

    1) MD5  (older)

        MD5HASHGENERATOR.COM

    2) SHA1  (CURRENT, GOVERNMENT APPROVED EG US GOV)

    POWER OF HASHING IS WHAT???

    1) PASSWORDS : NEVER STORE A REAL PASSWORD - ONLY 
        STORE HASH OF ALL PASSWORDS IN DATABASE

            MYFAVPASSWORD ==> HASH AND STORE XLJASDFSA;LKJFDAS

# MTA Security

MTA 98-367 Security

Encryption

```
3 types of encryption

1) Symmetric 
    Session Encryption (eg Shopping 'session')
2) Asymmetric
3) Hashing
    
Also 2) and 3) combined ==> Digital Signatures and Certificates
        
    ==> foundation for all INTERNET SECURITY

```

Symmetric Encryption = Shared Key

```
WIFI

Plain text	ALGORITHM	KEY		Encrypted text
                (WIFI key)

        SAME		unique

        WEP
        WPA 
        WPA2

WIFI is relatively INSECURE because ONE KEY is both
    doing ENCRYPTION and DECRYPTION

    One key is doing so much work ==> vulnerability

Passwords tend to be quite weak also so we can do two things
    1) SALT
    2) KEY STRETCHING

SALT : BCrypt is a tradename for this technology

Plain text + WPA2 + WIFI Key + SALT (extra password) ==> Final
                             encrypted
                             text

    regular password + salt ==> extended password

    If hacker did ever work out the (stored) extended password
        then they still can't hack your account until
        they next get the salt.

Exam
    WEP 	hacked
    WPA	over	TKIP	
    WPA2 	over	AES

Older protocols

    DES
    3DES	which is data run through DES three times
    Bluefish
    Twofish
    RC2  /   RC4

```

Asymmetric Encryption

```
Two keys : Public key & Private key

Public key : anyone can have
Private key : must be kept secure eg private ATM debit card in
            wallet.

Encrypt data ==> use either key!!!

    Decrypt data ==> must use OTHER KEY 

Examples

    Jill send Bob some encrypted data that ONLY BOB CAN OPEN

    Bob send Jill his PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE
    Jill can import this and install it on her computer

        Double click on certificate ==> runs 'import 
        certificate' wizard

    Select her file and encrypt with BOB'S PUBLIC KEY
    
    Send encrypted file to Bob

    Bob ==> use his own PRIVATE KEY to DECRYPT FILE AND READ IT

        ((Bob is only person in world with this private key))

Second example

    A military commander wants to send a message to the troops

    Commander : encrypt message with PRIVATE KEY
    Send to troops.
    They can use COMMANDER'S PUBLIC KEY TO DECRYPT ==> can
        now be sure message came from commander and 
        can be trusted.

Exam
    RSA most common protocol  ((Remember : Republic of South
                        Africa!!!!))

```

Hashing

```
Hashing is also called 'one way encryption' because there is no way
    to reverse engineer your hash

input file/text		MD5	===> produce hash
            SHA1

MD5 weak
SHA1 stronger

today

SHA256
SHA512 in real life

Examples sha1-online.com

        MD5
phil		d14ffd41334ec4b4b3f2c0d55c38be6f
phil <space>	fdcffb2dda54dff940c0a541f1cee85c	
phil.		dcd4936713c27cae72c65e90c1e60a66	

Compare with 

SHA1		e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

SHA256					4b25923a4f31b83195ceb0d160e0a1a6d1
        556b5a2cd4c582ff40aa0498ae1578

SHA512					055244bd6fc27c55e1ee33f71a0fd87e32bd
        9b1d19bd7ed636a6588b375a1e966a45c3e1
        4707d4ea45ed35a13cd95fa7df420fa52cfb
        b190ee0497c9dbcc33fb

Warning!!!

    Attackers cannot REVERSE ENGINEER then they do the 
        next best thing

    They collect HASHES in large files called RAINBOW TABLES

```

Session Key Encryption

```
Online shopping needs to be FAST!!!

HTTPS uses the following technology

1) Use ASYMMETRIC KEYS (slow) to GENERATE SYMMETRIC KEYS (fast)

2) Use, for our website browsing, these SYMMETRIC KEYS (fast)

    BUT!!  symmetric keys are ALSO WEAK!!! EASILY HACKED!!!

3) Every 10 minutes, just create new SYMMETRIC KEYS!!!

This gives us

    FAST BROWSING (symmetric key)

    SECURE BROWSING (sessions only last 10 minutes)

```

Certificates and Digital Signing

```
We can create CERTIFICATES and use DIGITAL SIGNING to create
a secure environment for business around the world

1. Take our files which we want to 'sign'

2. Hash these files           files  +   hash

3. Private key : encrypt the hash

                  files   +   hash    + encryped hash

4. Call the 'encrypted hash' the SIGNATURE of the file

    It represents the file uniquely

    file ===>   encrypted hash (signature of file)

Now we may want to validate this file and the signature

    eg COURT OF LAW
    eg DRIVER SIGNATURE BEFORE INSTALL (ALL DRIVERS ARE SIGNED)
            

Validation process

    1. Take our FILE and the SIGNATURE (encrypted hash)

    2. To validate we also now need the PUBLIC KEY OF
        THE PERSON WHO SIGNED THE FILE

        ((think driver : get Microsoft's public key))
            ((stored in CERTIFICATE ROOT STORE))
    
    3. Take PUBLIC KEY and use it to DECRYPT THE HASH!!!

        file  +  hash 

    4. Revalidate the hash is good.

        file ==> afresh, run it through hashing algorithm
            and get another fresh hash

        file  + hash   +   fresh hash

    5.  if two hashes (old and new) match then DRIVER IS 
        VALID AND GOOD TO INSTALL

```

Authentication

```
PROVING WHO YOU ARE : PROVIDING CREDENTIAL

What you know		password/pin

         are		biometric finger/eye/voice

     have		Smartcard, ATM card

Where you are		Geolocation by IP

Captcha	: validate you are a PERSON  not a BOT

Multifactor authentication

    eg Password + Smartcard or Text message	

Mutual authentication

    between servers 

    Each server has to trust the other one

        802.1X to NEGOTIATE TRUST USING CERTIFICATES
            PASSED FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER

Smartcard login

    TOKEN ON CARD : TOKEN BASED AUTHENTICATION

RADIUS = authentication server

    WIFI =========>RADIUS===========>ACTIVE DIRECTORY

    VPN ==========>RADIUS===========>ACTIVE DIRECTORY

    RADIUS server will authenticate you by talking to 
        ACTIVE DIRECTORY

    RADIUS   = original method
    DIAMETER = stronger
    TACACS+  = best (strongest)

```

Active Directory

```
LDAP Port 389

Kerberos : domain security

    Log in : user receives 'token' with permissions

    Access folder : check token permissions ==> granted/blockecd
            access

```

Local login

```
SAM Security Accounts Manager ==> LOCAL USER DATABASE ON WINDOWS PC

NTLM NT LAN MANAGER ==> WINDOWS CLIENT SECURITY LOGIN SYSTEM (OLD)

Chapter 4 : Networking

```
Snap Revision

```

NAP network access protection

```
NAC Network Access Control

With many employees working from home and dialing in using VPN
    we have potentially an issue with viruses spreading
    from home into the workplace.  Also laptops used outside
    the LAN can infect the workplace when plugged in.

Solution

    NAP

        When a machine connects to corporate network 
        we check :

        1) 	Windows Updates : up to date

        2)	AntiVirus : on and up to date

        3)	Antivirus scan : no viruses

        Do a 'health check' on machine

        If Fail ==> use DHCP to put machine into
            quarantine to 'force' machine to become
            compliant

        ==> Pass ==> Certificate of health 

            ==> allowed onto network

Routing

    Distance Vector

        RIP : old  (30 seconds : all data broadcast)

        EIGRP : new			

        Distance : hops (31 max)

    Link State

        Split globe into 'areas'

        Every company gets unique ID
        Send data to company and internally route via
            smaller areas

        OSPF

        Bigger, complex, more expensive to run

DHCP 

    lease time : 8 days

    do nothing : renew at 1/2 time ie 4 days

Loops

    SWITCHES

        STP Spanning Tree Protocol : auto-stop loops

    ROUTERS

        Convergence : time to stabilise after a change
                takes place

        Split Horizon

            Don't advertise routes back to the 
            interface they came from 

        Poison Reverse

            Allocate high cost (hop count = 16) to
            any routes going back to original router

```

ADVANCED ATTACKS

```
Injection attacks

    SQL injection
    XML injection
    LDAP injection

    Fight against this by using INPUT VALIDATION

        Prevent odd characters from displaying etc

Man in the middle attack

    CLIENT------------BAD ROUTER-------------SERVER

        1) Eavesdropping : listen in to traffic								(should encrypt!)
        2) Alter data in some way 

Session hijack attack

    CLIENT-----------BAD ROUTER--------------SERVER

    CLIENT-----------BAD ROUTER              SERVER

    Client : thinks they are talking to server but no longer!!!

            Router has taken over full session

Replay attack

    BAD ROUTER will collect all the packets from a session.

        Later on, will fire packets back at, say the server.

            Server might think this is the client trying
            to connect again so begin communication.  
            Open door for bad router to infect server

    Guard against ==> TIMESTAMP ALL PACKETS

```

Encryption on VPN and LAN traffic

```
1) VPN across internet

    L2TP tunnel : encrypt data with IPSEC (strong)

    IKEV2 tunnel :                  IPSEC (strong)

    SSTP tunnel :                   SSL/TLS (strong)

2) Machine-to-machine ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LAN

    Put RAW IPSEC BY ITSELF as encryption mechanism 
        between 2 computers or group of computers

    !!! care !!!  lock down computers !!! 

    Set up IPSEC in 2 places
        1) firewall : advanced
        2) Group policy

    AH	Authentication header	- ID/login
    ESP	Encryption of data
    SA	Security Association is a live channel

    IPSEC types

        DOMAIN ISOLATION : all computers in domain 
                    have IPSEC on

        TUNNEL MODE : to subnet (group of computers)

        POINT-TO-POINT (END-TO-END) TRANSPORT MODE

            between 2 individual computers

```

Virtual Smart Cards

```
Real smart card

    SERVER : HOLD PUBLIC CERTIFICATE

    USER : CARD : HOLD COPY PRIVATE KEY  (SECURE)

        Validate with your smart card : key pair activate
        to provide assurance it's you.

Virtual Smart Card

    Create a 'virtual' card which is not real but stored in
        the RAM of your computer

        ==> use it to perform transactions instead of swiping
            a real smart card

```

Encrypting DNS

```
DNS by itself is PLAIN TEXT

Secure it 2 methods

    1) Put DNS inside Kerberos/Active Directory secure 
        encrypted data.   DNS fully hidden in same
        technology that protects Active Directory.

    2) DNS SEC  : add PKI certificates to DNS records to ensure
        they are 			
        1) from correct sender
        2) not corrupted in transit (hash integrity)

```

Advanced Network Attacks

```
XSS Cross Site Scriping

    Hacking into second website by gaining access to first
        website.

XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery

    If you are LOGGED IN ALREADY THEN COMPUTER GRANT YOU
    PERMISSION TO ACCESS FILES. MORE POWER TO HACK FROM
    ONE WEBSITE TO ANOTHER

Buffer Overflow

    Cache : temporary file store

    Buffer : use on NETWORK DEVICES as 'cushion' when sending
            data

        Buffer overflow attack : exceed approved memory	
        limits to perhaps hack in to other (restricted)
        areas of memory

DNS Poison
    
    Corrupt DNS records  (Pharming)

```

Protecting your WIFI

```
1) Turn off SSID broadcast : minor benefit.

2) MAC filtering : STRONG but LOTS OF WORK!!! 

3) 802.1x port security/blocking : certificates to validate
        devices : advanced but good

4) turn off unused ports

```

Email protection

```
PGP		encrypt email
S/MIME		encrypt email

SPF sender policy framework : ENSURE SENDER IS REAL SENDER

```

Internet Explorer

```
Zones
    Internet
    Intranet
    Blocked
    Allowed

Popups
    
SmartScreen filter  	list of banned websites

Inprivate browsing	Chrome Incognito 	NO HISTORY		

Inprivate filtering

    Block on COOKIES tracking your behaviour
    set limit eg 10 hits OK but any more than this : block	

```

Hardening your server

```
LOCK IT DOWN!!!!

a) Uninstall ROLES/APPS not needed
b) firewall ports
c) server GUI ==> remove GUI so only have SERVER CORE
d) check updates 
e) Analyse server for weaknesses

    MBSA Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser

        free download

7 Layer OSI Model

1. Physical

    Job of physical layer is to actually pulse out electricity
    from your machine onto the network

    Cabling
    Ethernet
    UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair
    STP Shielded Twisted Pair
    RJ45
    COAX

    ```
        RG58  (TV cable today) (Thinnet)

        RG8   (original COAX 'Thicknet')

        Connector : BNC connector
                F-connector

     Fiber
        MonoMode : Expensive Pure Laser (50km)
        Multimode : Cheap LED light (2km)

        Connector : MT-RJ, ST, SC

    ```

    WIFI
    Sending signals using EM (electromagnetic) radiation

    DEVICES AT LAYER 1

    ```
     CABLES
     
     HUB : Primitive device which has no knowledge of 			packets etc.  Just electricity in and electricity 
     out.  
        BAD : BROADCASTS ON ALL PORTS, ALL TRAFFIC
                RECEIVED
     REPEATER
        Extend Ethernet max distance (100m) eg
            to 200m or even more

         ((5-4-3 rule : max of 5 repeaters))

    ```

Layer 2 : Data Link Layer

```
Uses MAC Address to SEND SIGNALS LOCALLY ON LAN
MAC ADDRESS  :  PHYSICAL ADDRESS 

    IPCONFIG /ALL

        30-85-A9-9A-6D-0C

    VALID ON LAN ONLY

    ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA AROUND OUR
        LAN, USING MAC ADDRESS OF EACH COMPUTER
        AS UNIQUE ID

        NOTE : ETHERNET FRAME = UNIT OF DATA

DEVICE WORKING AT THIS LAYER	

SWITCH

    UNLIKE THE HUB, THE SWITCH IS SUPER EFFICIENT

    HUB SPEEDS : MAX 10MBPS AND 1/n IF n DEVICES 
                CONNECTED
             20 DEVICES : ONLY GET 1/20 OF 10MPBS!!!			
    SWITCH SPEEDS : NEARLY ALL DEVICES GET FULL SPEED
            OF SWITCH EG 100MBPS OR 1000MBPS

        (MBPS = MEGA BITS PER SECOND)

        ((Does this by creating a 'virtual circuit'
            in switch for each connection))

    ((Stacking Switches : use UPLINK or TRUNKING port
                to connect!!!))

LAYER 2 SUMMARY 
    LAN ONLY!
    SWITCHES USE MAC ADDRESS TO GET DATA ROUND LAN
    ETHERNET PROTOCOL USED TO SEND DATA 'FRAMES'

```

Layer 3 : Network Layer
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN
Layer 3 : Global Internet = WAN

```
IP address

    Two types : private and public

    Private IP
        EG 
            192.168.x.y
            172.16.x.y-172.31.x.y
            10.x.y.z

        ALSO    169.254.X.Y  (APIPA ADDRESS IF
                    DHCP FAILS)	

        ALSO 	127.0.0.1  LOOPBACK IP TEST ADDRESS
                   (IS IP WORKING ON MY PC)			
            PING 127.0.0.1
            PING LOCALHOST
            PING ::1

        Private IP Addresses are FREE  but NOT
        VALID FOR USE ON THE INTERNET

    Public IP

        Use 'whatismyip' to find out your PUBLIC IP!

        Public IP addresses cost money around $5 a 
            month

        So : only buy one and allocate to our
            'Default Gateway'

        VALID FOR USE ON GLOBAL INTERNET TO GET 
        TRAFFIC FROM A TO B

Routing

    Routing enables data to be sent around the world

    Routers : share info amongst each other on routes

        Data shared using 'Routing Protocol' like
        RIP or OSPF to share BEST ROUTES with
        NEIGHBOURING ROUTERS

    Distance can be measured in 'hops' (1 hop is 
        1 router to next)

        or GEOGRAPHIC 'AREAS' SIMILAR TO POSTAL
        SERVICE WITH CONTINENT/COUNTRY/REGION/CITY/
        STREET/HOUSE NUMBER

        (( PATHPING

           TRACERT  ))

```

Layer 4 : Transport

```
Layer 1 : Physical
Layer 2 : LAN Ethernet Addressing
Layer 3 : IP Global Addressing

    Problem with Layer 3 is that no tracking is provided

    Packets are sent 'connection-less' and we have 
        no idea if they arrived or not.

TCP

    Has two fields to check and count all packets
    out and received

    1) SEQUENCE NUMBER = PACKETS SENT 1,2,3,4,5

Networking Protocols

FTP
Port 20/21
File Transfer Protocol
Secure??? NO NO NO! Passwords PLAIN TEXT!!!

```
SFTP	encrypt over SSH secure shell  Port 22
FTPS	encrypt over SSL               Port 443

```

Bittorrent

```
CARE CARE CARE!!!  VIRUS ALERT!!!

Takes a large file and splits it into 'seeds'.

    Each seed gets downloaded, but also if you enable
    it, your computer can now sent seeds to other
    computers which need it.

    ==> DISTRIBUTED FILE SHARING

        (Much more efficient)

```

Telnet
Port 23
Earliest days of computing : control another computer
across internet using command line

```
    PLAIN TEXT : NOT SECURE

```

SSH Secure Shell
Port 22
Encrypted Telnet

Email
SEND
SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Port 25
Plain text : insecure by default

```
RECEIVE

    POP
        Port 110
        Simple version

    IMAP
        Port 143
        Complex version eg multiple email clients

```

HTTP
Plain text web page
Port 80

HTTPS
Encrypted web page
Port 443
Protocols to encrypt : SSL and TLS (newer version of SSL)

DNS
Domain Name System
Maps name to IP eg [bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk/) to 1.2.3.4
Port 53

DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Port 67
Allocate IP to computer

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol
Log in to server remotely
Port 3389

```
==> KNOW THOSE PORTS ABOVE!!!

```

ICMP : Error message protocol for internet eg 404 unreachable

```
PING : (echo request) member of ICMP family

```

SNMP : Simple Network Management Protocol
Manage network of many devices : routers, switches, printers,
servers.

```
    1) Heartbeat message 30/60secs : Know machine is 
                    reachable

    2) States eg Throughput MB per hour

```

NETBIOS
Port 137
Used HOSTNAME to do NETWORKING (before DNS)

```
    PC01		1.2.3.4
    PC02		5.6.7.8

```

TFTP : Trivial FTP : Across LAN to copy eg new OS to CISCO SWITCH
Port 69

DMZ : De-Militarized Zone ==== PERMIMETER NETWORK

```
Used to host a public server eg WWW.myshop.com or similar.
Even if it does get hacked, minimum loss to organisation
as can't hack into secure LAN from there

```

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
Join two LANs securely using one of 4 encryption protocols

PPP : Create the dial up session (not encrypted)
    Point-to-point protocol : simply dials up and
                  creates the connection	

PPTP : Original Microsoft (not very secure)
    Point-to-point Tunneling Protocol
    PORT 1723

L2TP : Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
    Good, slow? from XP onwards...
    PORT 1701

SSTP : Uses Port 443 (HTTPS) which is already open
    (Secure Sockets Tunneling Protocol)

IKEV2 : Windows 7 onwards : has auto-reconnect if eg
        your wifi / 4g signal drops

```

VLAN
Virtual LAN

```
In order to keep departments separate we must create
VLANS which group SWITCH PORTS.

PORT		VLAN

1		VLAN01
2		VLAN01	
3		VLAN01       ports 1,2,3 can see each other

4		VLAN02
5		VLAN02
6		VLAN02	    ports 4,5,6 can see each other

EVERY PACKED GETS 'TAGGED' WITH THE VLANID ADDED
    TO EACH PACKET

```

Encryption (page 28)

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
USED A) WIFI
     B) WINDOWS NTFS ENCRYPTION!!!

WIFI

    ORIGINAL MESSAGE ==> ENCYPT WITH WPA2 USING AES
                ENCRYPTION + WIFI KEY

                ==> ENCRYPTED MESSAGE (SEND)

    DECRYPT MESSAGE AT OTHER END USING AES + SAME WIFI KEY

    ==> INSECURE AS SAME KEY BOTH ENCRYPT & DECRYPT SO 
            QUITE 'HACKABLE'

    EXAM : OLD WEP ENCRYPTION NO LONGER USED AS 'HACKED'
           CURRENT 
            WPA USING TKIP ENCYRPTION JUST OK
            WPA2      AES                OK (GOOD)

    OLDER SYMMETRIC PROTOCOLS : DES/3DES/BLOW/TWOFISH

WINDOWS ENCRYPTION

    SAME THING BUT  

        ==> YOUR PASSWORD IS THE KEY THIS TIME!!!

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION : SUMMARY : ONE KEY TO ENCRYPT AND 
            DECRYPT EG WIFI USING WPA2 & AES.

```

ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION = 'HASHING'

```
www.sha1-online.com

MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE UNHACKABLE IE CANNOT FIND 
    REVERSE PASSWORD 

    ==> HACKERS RESORT TO USING 'RAINBOW TABLES' WHICH
        ARE PRE-COMPUTED TABLES OF KNOWN PASSWORDS

WHY USE HASHES??
    
HASHES CAN REPRESENT FILES OR STRINGS UNIQUELY

    STRING  ==>  HASH

    FILE    ==>  HASH    

            CHANGE INPUT THEN OUTPUT HASH WILL
            CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

```

PKI PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY ENCRYPTION

```
TWO KEYS ARE ISSUED

    PRIVATE (KEPT SECURE)

    PUBLIC (GIVEN TO ANYONE)

ENCRYPT WITH ONE ==> DECRYPT WITH OTHER (WORKS BOTH WAYS)

PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE AND ROCK SOLID => COURTS OF LAND
            WOULD ACCEPT AS EVIDENCE

THREE USES:

1)  ALICE SENDS BOB A FILE AND ONLY BOB TO READ FILE

    ALICE ENCRYPTS FILE WITH BOB'S PUBLIC KEY (ANYONE
            CAN GET HOLD OF)
    SEND TO BOB
    BOB USES HIS PRIVATE KEY TO UNLOCK AND READ

2) COMMAND HQ SENDS ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO ALL PERSONNEL.
    PEOPLE WANT TO VERIFY IT'S GENUINE.

    HQ WILL ENCRYPT WITH HQ PRIVATE KEY
    RECIPIENTS CAN UNLOCK WITH HQ PUBLIC KEY, THEREFORE
        CAN BE CONFIDENT IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM HQ
        AND NO-ONE ELSE

Science of looking at all possibilities 

    Threat : to organisation

        Internal
        External
        Man-made
        Natural

    Vulnerability : can be exploited by attacker

    Risk : % chance (high/med/low) that a
        vulnerability in our system will
        be exploited

        POT HOLES IN ROAD

            SMALL ==> ZERO CHANCE OF CLAIM

            UNATTENDED .. POT WILL GROW

            CHANCE WILL GROW OF CLAIM

CONFIDENTIALITY

    ENCRYPT DATA

INTEGRITY

    CAN TRUST THE DATA WE USE

    COURSE : INTEGRTITY ==> HASHING OF DATA AND FILES

        FILE1 ==> 'HASH' (MD5/SHA1) ==>
    
            FIXED LENGTH STRING WHICH 'REPRESENTS'
                FILE

            ((CHECK HASH BEFORE AND AFTER))

AVAILABILITY

    DATA MUST BE AVAILABLE (TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
        SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY)

```

NON-REPUDIATION

```
CANNOT DENY ELECTRONICALLY THAT A TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE

WAY WE DO THIS IS A FOLLOWS : 

    1) GET YOUR FILES AND/OR LOGS OF TRANSACTION 

    2) PUT THEM TOGETHER AND ZIP INTO ONE UNIT

    3) TAKE HASH OF ZIP FILE

    4) USING PKI PRIVATE KEY, WE NOW ENCRYPT 
        ONLY THE HASH OF THE TRANSACTION

        (( THIS ENCRYPTED HASH OF A TRANSACTION IS
           CALLED THE 'SIGNATURE' OF TRANSACTION))

          UNIQUE !!!

    5) THIS IS 'ROCK SOLID' AND VERIFIABLE IN A COURT 
        OF LAW - BUT HOW???

        ==> TAKE PUBLIC KEY OF SIGNATORY AND USE
            THIS TO DECRYPT THE HASH.

            TAKE ZIP FILE ==> GET FRESH HASH
            COMPARE FRESH HASH WITH DECRYPTED HASH

            ==> HASHES MUST MATCH

RULE BASED ACCESS

    EG TIMED ACCESS MIDNIGHT TO 6 : RUNNING BACKUP
        SO ALL USERS BANNED REGARDLESS OF 
        PERMISSION

```

IMPLICIT DENY

```
ALL USERS ARE BLOCKED ACCESS UNLESS EXPLIT PERMISSION

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION

    SERVERS MUST AUTHENTICATE EACH OTHER!!!

    USE 'CERTIFICATES' AND 'DIGITALLY SIGNING' OUR
    CERTIFICATE TO PRESENT OUR CERTIFICATE TO THE
    OTHER SERVER FOR VERIFICATION.

        ==> TRUST PROVIDER OF CERTIFICATE EG
            VERISIGN ==> THEN TRUST COMPUTER

CRYPTOGRAPHY = ENCRYPTION

```
WAYS TO ENCRYPT DATA

    STREAM CIPHER
    
        FAST BUT LESS SECURE!

        ONE CHARACTER ONLY GETS ENCRYPTED AT A TIME

            A  	=> 	Y
            B	=>	I
            C	=>	8

    BLOCK CIPHER		

        TAKES GROUP OF CHARACTERS EG 100 AT A TIME
        ENCRYPT THEM AS A BLOCK

        MUCH MORE SECURE, MUCH HARDER TO CRACK

        SLOWER!!!

SPEED OF ENCRYPTION

    SYMMETRIC

        FAST ==> CAN DO REAL-TIME

            WIFI
            SHORT-TERM 'SESSION' EG BANKING
                SESSION FOR 10 MINUTES			

    ASYMMETRIC

        ROCK-SOLID!
        VERY SLOW!!!

    HASHING : NOT REAL TIME EITHER

DATA DISPOSAL

```
MAGNETIC DATA CAN BE RESTORED BY CROOKS IF WE DISPOSE
    OF IT CASUALLY.  STRICT POLICIES EXIST TO 
    ENFORCE CORRECT METHOD OF 'DISPOSING' OF DATA

1. WIPE OUR HARD DRIVE WITH RANDOM DATA 7 TIMES OVER

    (( THINK MUDDY FIELD : DRIVE 100 CARS ROUND 
        FIELD 10 MINUTES : ERASE ORIGINAL 
        TRACKS ))

2. DEGAUSS : TAKE A MAGNET AND WIPE DRIVE

3. PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION EG HAMMER OR PHYSICALLY SHRED DRIVE

            CLIENTS GET FASTER ACCESS

3) FILTERING : WHITELIST (GOOD SITES) /BLACKLIST (BLOCKED

MOBILE SECURITY

```
MOBILE SECURITY IS A 'HOT' ISSUE - WHY???

BYOD : BRING OWN DEVICE : PEOPLE USING PERSONAL DEVICES
    TO GET WORK DONE

    SECURITY RISK WITH COMPANY SENSITIVE INFO ON DEVICE
    WHICH IS 

    A) PERSONALLY OWNED
    B) NOT LOCKED DOWN
    C) NO CONTROL OVER OTHER APPS INSTALLED, IF THEY	
        ARE SNOOPING ETC
    

SOLUTION : ???

    ONE SOLUTION IS TO ONLY PERMIT 'REMOTE-DESKTOP' OR
    CITRIX-STYLE ACCESS WHERE PHONE JUST A 'WINDOW' TO
    REMOTE SERVER, NO DATA STORED ON MOBILE DEVICE

REMOTE LOCK

Risk

```
Risk Analysis Process

    1. IDENTIFY YOUR ASSETS

        Equipment of value
        Data ==> OF HIGHEST VALUE EVEN THOUGH
            MAYBE CAN'T PUT PRICE ON IT!
        People 
            Knowledge and Experience of 
            key personnel
        Building

       EXAM : AV ==> ASSET VALUE
    
    2. Identify Vulnerabilities / Weaknesses

    3. Identify Threats (Internal/External/Man-made/
                Natural)

    4. Probability Chart 

        % likelihood that a particuar threat
            will materialise and threaten
            a vulnerability

            eg 10% chance pothole x in road y
                   will generate an insurance
                   claim

        SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY

            $$$COST OF ONE OCCURRENCE		

        ARO ANNUAL RATE OF OCCURRENCE

            PREDICTED NUMBER OF TIMES A YEAR
            THIS WILL HAPPEN

        ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY

            $$$EXPECTED LOSSES IN 1 YEAR				

    5. IMPACT ANALYSIS : LOOKING AT COSTS ABOVE OR
        OTHER EVENTS WHICH CAN'T BE MEASURED
        WITH MONEY EG LOSS OF MORALE, MOTIVATION,
        LOSS OF FACE, LOSS OF REPUTATION ETC ...
    

    6. WHAT DO WE DO??? 

        NOTHING  IE LIVE WITH RISK (EG CROSSING ROAD)
    
        INSURE (TRANSFER) OUR RISK BY INSURING
            AGAINST LOSS EG FOOTBALLER INSURE
                    LEG

        PUT UP WARNING SIGNS AS DETERRENCE TO 
            ATTACKERS : PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
        
        AVOID THE RISK ALTOGETHER BY DOING SOMETHING
            ELSE (DON'T CROSS THE ROAD BUT USE
                THE TUNNEL!)

        SPEND SOME MONEY OR TAKE ACTION

            "MITIGATION" => TAKE ACTION TO 
                    MINIMISE OUR LOSS

            EG CREATE POLICIES, BUILD DEFENCES,
               EDUCATE USERS, ADVICE FROM EXPERTS,
               TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AGAINST
               POTENTIAL ATTACKER
               
               
ATTACK SURFACE ==> SOMETHING IN WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED TO 
            A THREAT

HONEYPOT

    DECOY TO DISTRACT ATTACKER 1) THEY ARE DISTRACTED
                   2) WE CAN PERHAPS MONITOR
                      THEM

Scanning for vulnerabilities

```
Enemy may do the following : 

    Footprinting : use common sense methods to try and
            gain info on you.  Using methods
            which may be legal eg public 
            birth/death/marriage records, 
            public accounts records, website info

    Enumerating : Using illegal methods to gain further
              detailed info about you.

              EG  COMPANY : DOING PORT SCANS, 
               HACKING IN AND GETTING NETWORK INFO,
               IP INFO, PORT INFO, SERVER NAME 
               INFO, NAMES OF KEY PEOPLE WHO
    
            Personal level : credit card info,
                security answers to questions

You may do the following

    Vulnerability Scan

    Port scan

    Deep-level test to try and penetrate your network
            eg using ethical hackers etc

```

IT IS IMPORTANT IN A COURT OF LAW THAT EVIDENCE IS 
    ADMISSIBLE.  IF NOT, IT CANNOT BE USED
    AGAINST A DEFENDANT	

INVESTIGATING A CRIME

    1. LOOK AT ANYTHING 'VOLATILE'  <<VOLATILITY>>

        TURN OFF ==> INFO DISAPPEARS

        EG  CONTENTS OF RAM OR PAGE FILES ETC

    2. HARD DRIVE : TAKE IMAGE STRAIGHT AWAY

        SIGN/HASH IMAGE 

    3. CREATE A 'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'

        SIGNED LIST OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR
        EVIDENCE AT ALL TIMES

DISASTER RECOVERY

```
FAULT TOLERANCE = RECOVERY FROM FAULT

    EG RAID 5  :   DRIVE FAILS ==> STILL SURVIVE
       CLUSTER :   SERVER FAILS ==> GO TO SERVERB

SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE = ONE THING WHICH, IF IT BREAKS, 
        MAKES YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM FAIL (EG YOUR BRAIN!)

    ROUTER : GATEWAY : TO INTERNET
    SWITCH : CENTRAL POINT OF NETWORK

        IN CERTAIN EVENTS EG WEBSITE GETS HACKED.

BIA BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS : WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THREAT
        X MATERIALIZES (IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS)

MTD MAX TOLERABLE DOWNTIME

    EG IF SERVER GOES DOWN, IT MUST BE UP WITHIN 2 DAYS	

RPO : RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

    HOW FREQUENT ARE YOUR BACKUPS???
    IF DISASTER, HOW MUCH DATA ARE YOUR PREPARED TO LOSE?
    EG EVERY 4 HOURS YOU BACKUP, THEN POTENTIALLY
    ARE YOU PREPARED TO LOSE 4 HOURS WORTH OF DATA?

RTO RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE : PLANNED TIME BY WHICH WE 
    HAVE FIXED AN ITEM AND GET EVERYTHING WORKING

```

HOT/WARM/COLD SITE

```
HOT SITE : 100% READY TO GO - COMPUTERS, NETWORK

        *** TOO COSTLY ! ***

WARM SITE : PCS THERE, SHUT DOWN.  1-2 DAYS TO GET SET 
    UP, RESTORE BACKUPS, BEGIN WORK.

        *** HIGH BUT REASONABLE COST **

COLD SITE : JUST BARE SHELL OF BUILDING WITH WATER AND
        ELECTRICITY AND LITTLE ELSE

    1-2 WEEKS TO SET UP

```

MTTF MEAN TIME TO FAIL = AVERAGE TIME BEFORE EG HARD DRIVE FAIL (3 YEARS)

```
==> MTBF MEAN TIME BETWEEN FAILURES

```

MTTR MEAN TIME TO REPAIR : AVERAGE TIME TO FIX EG SERVER

Presentation
Application

Physical : Layer 1

Cabling

```
Copper

    TP Twisted Pair : 8 cables in 4 pairs

        UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair
        STP Shielded Twisted Pair

    Plenum  : fire rated cable (longer before burns)

        USED TO STOP FIRE SPREADING BETWEEN BUILDINGS 

    
    COAX
        THICKNET = 10BASE5 = RG8

            ORIGINAL : FIRST CABLE : ROBUST (500M)
            10BASE5  (speed 10Mbps, length 500m)

                    Mbps Mega BITS PER SECOND
                    (MB  Mega BYTES STORAGE)
            RG8

        THINNET = 10BASE2 = RG58

            10base2 : Speed 10Mbps, Length 200m (185m)
            Used for TV today

        
    Connectors
        RJ45	Network
        RJ11	Phone

        BNC		(coax)
        F-Connector	(coax)   *** NOT FIBER!!! **

Fiber
    Single Mode (Mono mode) - Pure laser light : 50km

    Multi Mode : cheaper : LED light : 2km
        Better for city-wide networks
            MAN Metropolitan Area Network
            CAN Campus Area Network (university)

            (((   LAN local
                      WAN wide : long distance
                  PAN personal : bluetooth direct 
                        communication)))

```

Layer 1 Devices

```
Hub  :   DEAL WITH ELECTRICITY ONLY IE SIGNAL IN ==> SIGNAL
        BROADCAST OUT ON ALL OTHER PORTS (INEFFICIENT)

Repeater : 2-port hub

    Used to EXTEND ETHERNET from 100m (max) to 200m

    |---------100m-----|repeater|--------100m---------|

```

Layer 1 summary : ANYTHING YOU CAN TOUCH!
CABLING : COPPER : UTP/STP
COAX THICKNET/THINNET
FIBER MONOMODE (LASER) 50KM
MULTIMODE (LED) 2KM
HUB
REPEATER

```
Port included also : physically plug cables in

```

Exam Topics

```
UTP Unshielded so VULNERABLE TO EMI interference  (RFI radio)
                and EAVESDROPPING (listen in)
COAX : Natural shield on outside so protected

FIBER : ZERO INFLUENCE FROM RFI/EMI radiation

```

Layer 2 : Data Link

```
GETTING DATA ROUND OUR LOCAL LAN!!!

PC------------SWITCH----------PC

EVERY DEVICE HAS UNIQUE ADDRESS ==> MAC Address

    IPCONFIG => SHOW IP
    IPCONFIG /ALL ==> SHOW MAC
    GETMAC
                
    18-66-DA-3E-0A-C8

    FIRST HALF = OUI = COMPANY WHICH MADE CARD  18-66-DA

      (Google 'oui' +  18-66-DA)

Sending Data on LAN

    Ethernet is the 'protocol' to TRANSPORT DATA
            
        Ethernet 'frame' = packet of data

    |Preamble|Dest MAC |Source MAC | DATA | CRC Error check|

    Preamble ==> get ready, clocks sync ==> data is arriving!

    
Switch

    Examine 'source' and 'destination' MAC 

    Build table of attached PCs

    Port		MAC
    1		aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff
    2		..

    SWITCH will connect computers 1-1 (very fast)

            
Layer 2 summary
    SWITCH links computers using MAC ADDRESS
    DATA sent using ETHERNET 	

```

Layers 3 : Network

```
Layer 1 : Physical : cabling
Layer 2 : LOCAL LAN : MAC : ETHERNET : SWITCH
Layer 3 : Global Addressing with IP

Private IP

    FREE!!!

    4 ranges
        10.x.y.z			CLASS A
        172.16.x.y - 172.31.x.y RANGE         B
        192.168.x.y			      C

        169.254.x.y	==> APIPA Automatic Private IP
                            Address
                ((DHCP broken so you get this 
                        instead))		

    Private IP ==> BANNED FROM INTERNET!!!

Public IP

    PAID!!!  $5/month!
    
    Google 'whatismyip'    147.35.10.33

    5 ranges		
      Class A	1-126   (looking at FIRST NUMBER ONLY)		
        Loopback  127.0.0.1  (Test Network card working)
            PING 127.0.0.1 = 
            PING localhost = 
            PING ::1
            B	128-191 
                C	192-223 
            D	224-239 	MULTICAST : SEND DATA TO 
                    GROUP OF COMPUTERS
        E	240-255 

Subnet Mask

    Can be used to tell which computers are on SAME NETWORK

    IP	192		168		10 		20
    MASK	255		255		255		0		        MASK 	11111111	11111111	11111111    00000000
    (binary)					 ^^
                            split
    Mask : SPLIT IP INTO TWO PARTS

        Left : Network ID		    Right : Host ID
                  192.168.10			20
        All computers on same network
        have SAME NETWORK ID

    CLASS A/B/C MASK
        CLASS A		255.0.0.0
              B		255.255.0.0
              C		255.255.255.0

Summary so far : Layer 3 gives us an IP ADDRESS to enable 
        GLOBAL COMMUNICATION

    ping facebook.com ==> 31.13.91.36  actually facebook lives
                       on this IP!!!!

```

Routing (Still layer 3!!!)

```
So far : IP Provides ADDRESSING GLOBALLY

Also : ROUTING create BEST PATHS ACROSS INTERNET!!!

    HERE ==> CHINA : pre-create ROUTES beforehand!!!

        MEASURE DISTANCE IN 'HOPS' ( ONE ROUTER TO NEXT)
                    MAX HOPS : 31

            ((TTL TIME TO LIVE = 31,30,29,...3,2,1,0
                    ((CEASE TO EXIST))

Routing : think building ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE IN COUNTRY

RIP Routing Internet Protocol (v2)

    Creates best routes
    HOP = DISTANCE (('metric'))	
    INEFFICIENT (( broadcasts all data every 30 seconds!!!))

EIGRP : by Cisco

    Same as RIP but
    1-1 updates (no broadcast)
    only send update if a change has happened!!!

OSPF	Open Shortest Path First
    Splits world into 'areas'   ((think sending a letter))
                 
        OSPF truly global : efficient

RIP, EIGRP	==> 'distance vector' protocols (measure by 'hops')
OSPF	        ==> 'link state' : use areas

```

Layer 4 : Transport

```
Layer 2 : LAN ADDRESSING (MAC)
Layer 3 : IP ADDRESSING

    Layer 3 is called 'connection-less' as it doesn't give us
            feedback on WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED!!!

TCP : Transmission Control Protocol

    Job : feedback on WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED!!!

    TCP counts packets out

        SEQ = SEQUENCE NUMBER = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7	

        RECEIVER : ALSO SENDS BACK AN 'ACKNOWLEDGEMENT' 
        
        ACK = PACKET RECEIVED OK = 1,2,3,4,6,7

        SENDER : READ 1,2,3,4,6,7 AND KNOW PACKET 5 WENT
                MISSING!!!

        SENDER : RESEND PACKET 5 AND GET ACK 5 BACK

            ==> COMPLETE!!!  7 PACKETS SENT + RECEIVED					
    TCP = GUARANTEED DELIVERY  (CONNECTION-ORIENTED)

    TCP also begins all communication with 'TCP 3-WAY HANDSHAKE'

        1) Client : 'Hey server I've got data to send.
                    Are you ready?'
        2) Server : 'Yes OK, ready'
        3) Client : 'OK let's begin'

```

Layer 5 : Session Layer

```
STREAMS OF TRAFFIC TO/FROM DEVICE

    Extreme: Youtube video in 5 tabs playing same video!!!
    Add in : Skype, Whatsapp ...

```

Layer 6 : Presentation

```
1) ENCRYPT DATA HERE  	EG  http ==> https encrypted traffic

        HTTP PORT 80
        HTTPS PORT 443

2) COMPRESSION eg large 'BMP' bitmap ==> small JPG (compressed)
            'WMV' video            MP4 

```

Layer 7 : Application Layer eg Skype, Outlook etc

Networking Ports

```
What is a port???

A port is a CHANNEL TO SEND DATA

Think : IP is like a MEDIEVAL CASTLE :  no way in or out unless
                via approved channel!

    Illustrate dictionary.com:80 works!
                                     :81 does not work!

Port numbers run from

    1 to 65536 !!!   (2^16)

    1 to 1000  common
    1000 - 49000 registered
    49000+  anyone can use!!!
        

        Note : kilo = 1000 but in binary we have 
            2x2x2x.. = 2^10 = 1024

        Use 1024 as approx 1000 in computing
        1KB - 1000 APPROX	1024		10^3
        1MB - MILLION APPROX	.....		10^6
        1GB - BILLION				10^9
        1TB - TERABTE				10^12
        1PB - PETABYTE				10^15

```

Common Ports!!!

```
FTP File Transfer Protocol
    20 DATA
        21 ADMIN

    PLAIN TEXT!!! NOT SECURE!!!

    SFTP	FTP OVER ...
    FTPS	FTP OVER ...

Torrent (Peer-to-peer)

    Better than FTP
    Splits large files into 'SEEDS'
    Also can upload our SEEDS TO OTHER PEOPLE!!! (distributed)
        ** CARE !!! **
    

TELNET Terminal Emulation

    COMMAND LINE ACROSS THE INTERNET!!!
    NOT USED TODAY!!!
    Port 23

SSH Secure Shell
    Encrypted Telnet
    Port 22
    Used today (eg manage LINUX/IPHONE)

EMAIL
    OUT
        SMTP  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
              Port 25	

    IN
        POP	Simple
            Port 110

        IMAP	Complex
            Port 143

HTTP	plain text 
    Port 80

HTTPS	encrypted
    Port 443
    Encrypted with SSL (old)  SECURE SOCKETS LAYER
               TLS (upgrade) TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY

        Exam : assume BOTH ARE GOOD!!!
               might get question : MUST BE AWARE TLS
            NEWER (FIXES FAULT IN SSL)
            
        Real life : SSL is 'deprecated' ((no longer 					officially supported))

DNS Domain Name System

    Like a phone book

    Name		IP
    facebook.com	31.13.91.36

    Port 53

    (( NSLOOKUP give DNS info   eg NSLOOKUP google.com ))

DHCP 	Give computer IP Address

    PC ====>> BROADCAST 'HELP! I NEED AN IP'

            <<============= DHCP SERVER : GIVES IP

    D	DISCOVER	CLIENT : HELP !  I NEED AN IP!!!
                         (BROADCAST)
    O	OFFER		SERVER : HERE IS ONE!
    R	REQUEST		CLIENT : OK FINE, I WILL TAKE IT!
    A	ACK (NOWLEDGE)	SERVER : DONE

    PORT 67/68

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol

    Log in to another computer remotely

    Port 3389

```

Harder Ports

```
HOSTNAME = NAME OF COMPUTER!

NETBIOS = DOING NETWORKING USING HOSTNAME ONLY!!!  (PRIMITIVE!)
    PORT 137-139

SNMP SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

    PORT 161-162
    50 ROUTERS -- ARE THEY ALL UP???  (ALIVE!)

        30 SECONDS ==> HEARTBEAT 'I AM ALIVE' SENT

    Copy files on LAN 
    EG Cisco router : New operating system
    Port 69

DMZ De-Militarized Zone

    Host PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE on OUTSIDE OF OUR LAN

    PUBLIC
    WEB
    SERVER--------------------
                ROUTER

                    SECURE LAN

VPN Virtual Private Network

    Tunnel through the internet

    PPP ==> Dials up : Creates connection (point-to-point 							     protocol)
    
    4 Secure protocols:

    PPTP		Point-to-point tunnel	OLD!
            Port 1723

    L2TP/IPSEC	Layer 2 Tunneling 
            STRONG!  Certificates!
            Port 1701

    SSTP		Secure Sockets Tunneling
            VPN over HTTPS
            Port 443

    IKEV2		Strong!
            Ports 500, 4500  UDP
            
            VPN Reconnect!!!  Auto-reconnect within
            30 minutes (eg if on WIFI)

```

Switch

```
1 port typically runs at 1GBPS  (giga bits per second)

We can STACK THE SWITCHES!

    JOIN THEM ==> TRUNK PORT (10Gbps)
              (UPLINK PORT)

    SWITCH1
            |     |
    |     |
    SWITCH2
        Loops !!!  Cause problems!!!
        STP Spanning Tree Protocol ==> AUTO BLOCKS LOOPS

```

VLAN Virtual LAN

```
Split up a SWITCH into SMALLER LANS - each one is SEPARATE 
    from the other

802.1Q  ==> OFFICIAL NAME

We can 'tag' each packet with the VLAN ID eg VLAN01, VLAN02 ETC

```

Encryption

```
Cryptography = science of encryption

ALGORITHM = Program (fixed) which encrypts data eg AES, DES, RCA

KEY = something UNIQUE WHICH CHANGES EVERY TIME SO OUTCOME OF
        ENCRYPTION IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT

Plain  ==>  algorithm   +   key                 ==> Cipher text
text						    (encrypted)

PLUS!!! Extra strength we add second key called 'salt'

        algorithm   +   key    + salt (random
                     extra password)
                       (Exam:BCRYPT)

          AES          wifi key  + salt (auto 
                    generated)

```

3 types of encryption

```
1) 	SYMMETRIC

2) 	ASYMMETRIC

3) 	HASHING

```

SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
FAST!
NOT VERY SECURE!
USED VERY OFTEN  
    A) WIFI
    B) HTTPS:// BROWSING
    
WIFI

PLAIN 
TEXT		AES		WIFI KEY	SALT     ENCRYPTED
                               DATA

ONE KEY DOES BOTH A) ENCRYPTION B) DECRYPTION !!!

    ((ONE KEY DOING A LOT OF WORK ==> VULNERABLE!))

HOW CAN WE MAKE IT STRONGER???

    IF WE LIMIT THE TIME FOR EACH KEY TO 10 MINUTES THEN
    AN ATTACKER CAN'T BREAK IN DURING THIS TIME

    HTTPS:// USES THIS   :  CREATE 'SESSION' WHEN ONLINE

    CREATE FIRST KEY : LAST 10 MINUTES
    AFTER 10 MINUTES : RECREATE SECOND KEY ETC....
        KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU FINISH OR STOP USING SITE

WIFI ==> ONE KEY !!!  EASY TO HACK!

HTTPS ==> KEYS CHANGE 10 MINUTES ==> IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK

    = "SESSION KEY"

EXAM : WHICH PROTOCOLS????

    WIFI: 
        WEP			 WEP  : HACKED
        WPA OVER TKIP            TKIP : OK
        WPA2 OVER AES		 AES  : EXAM : GOOD ANSWER!

    NOT WIFI!

        DES
        3DES	(USE DES THREE TIMES!)
        BLOWFISH
        TWOFISH

        AES!!!    KING!!! GO FOR THIS IF NOT SURE!!

    NOTE
        CCMP UPGRADE TO AES

SYMMETRIC SUMMARY
    FAST BUT LESS SECURE
    ONE KEY : ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT
    AES AND CCMP BEST; OLDER ARE DES, 3DES, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH

```

ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

```
Uses two keys

Private and public

    Any can encrypt; other will decrypt

Rock solid !!! Web ACTUALLY RELIES ON THIS !!!

    Example : Verisign certificate : 30 years!!!

Super slow!!  But very secure!!!

Example :   Bob send Joe an encrypted file that only Joe can open

    1) Joe has PUBLIC KEY : SEND TO BOB (OK AS KEY IS PUBLIC)

    2) Bob : Encrypt file using JOE'S PUBLIC KEY

    3) Bob : Send to Joe

    4) Joe : Decrypt as he has the matching (PRIVATE) KEY to
            unlock the file

        ((399 Rayburn Box))

```

Hashing

```
ONE WAY ENCRYPTION

Phil	Hash ==> d14ffd41334ec4b4b3f2c0d55c38be6f

                    sha1-online.com		

Phil.		dcd4936713c27cae72c65e90c1e60a66
Phil,		660005620824c23f08bc0bf9b6025ac8
Phil<space>	fdcffb2dda54dff940c0a541f1cee85c

    EASILY SPOT IF FILE HAS CHANGED!!!

    DATA INTEGRITY ==> ENSURE SOURCE FILE IS NOT CORRUPT!!!

Hashing => INTEGRITY CHECK

MD5	OLDER
SHA1	NEWER

SHA256		real life (not exam)
SHA512 

phil	SHA1	e888d2bd6f13f82caa51a37c03d034c76f661ba3

    SHA512

```
SUMMARY : HASHING : ONE-WAY (CAN'T GO BACK!)

        MD5 OK
        SHA1 BETTER

Rainbow Table

    Bad guys : can't get back original password from hash!!!
        
    Instead : collect known passwords + hashes into huge tables
        (50GB) ==> so don't use short passwords!!!

```

SIGNING A FILE

```
1) HASH FILE
2) PRIVATE KEY : ENCRYPT THE HASH

    THIS 'ENCRYPTED HASH' WE CALL THE 'SIGNATURE' OF FILE.

        IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE : USE TO VERIFY FILE IS GENUINE

TO USE / VALIDATE A SIGNED FILE/DRIVER/PROGRAM

1) GET PUBLIC KEY OF THE 'SIGNER' AND USE IT TO DECRYPT THE HASH
2) TAKE A FRESH HASH
    FILE ==> HASH (AGAIN)
    DECRYPTED HASH ==> SHOULD MATCH 

USE THIS EVERYWHERE!!!  APPLE, MICROSOFT ALL USE 'SIGNED 			DRIVERS/APPS' ON ALL COMPUTERS

```

Chapter 1 : General Terms

```
C	Confidentiality		ENCRYPT FILES
I	Integrity		FILES NOT CHANGED (PROVE WITH HASH)
A	Availability		DATA AVAILABLE!!!

A	Authentication		LOG IN : PROVE YOUR IDENTITY :
                PRESENT CREDENTIALS
A	Authorisation		PERMISSION TO REACH FILE/WEBSITE/
                    DATABASE
                ACL : ACCESS CONTROL LIST : VIEW
                    USERS WHO HAVE ACCESS

A	Accounting/Auditing	LOG WHO DID WHAT, WHEN!

Confidentiality

```
Steganography

    Hiding encrypted data within an image or music file etc

```

Non-repudiation

```
Repudiate	reject, deny a statement or that something
            happened

Non-repudiation	Cannot deny that a transaction has happened : 
            use certificates

```

How can we PROVE A TRANSACTION IS GENUINE???

```
Answer : 'SIGN' the transaction files

    $1,000,000 database transaction
    Want to PROVE IT'S VALID BEYOND DOUBT
    1) Add timestamp 
    2) ZIP up database transaction files + timestamp
    3) ZIP ==> now 'sign it'

        a) HASH IT
        b) ENCRYPT HASH WITH OUR PRIVATE KEY

    Court case : prove genuine (later on!)

    1) ZIP ==> TAKE FRESH HASH
    2) COMPARE : FRESH HASH WITH OLD HASH
    3) OLD HASH : OBTAIN IT BY
        Decrypting the 'signed hash' with the signers
        PUBLIC KEY ==> REVEAL ORIGINAL HASH

        COMPARE OLD AND NEW HASH : SHOULD BE SAME!!!

```

Availability

```
Redundancy		Spare capacity to cope if there is a failure

Fault tolerance		System can keep running if there is a failure

```

Examples of Redundancy/Fault tolerance

```
Goal : AVOID 'SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE'

RAID

    Hard drives : build 'array'

        Example 'NAS drive'  NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE

    RAID 0	SUPER FAST !!!  BUT --> NO REDUNDANCY!!!
        "STRIPING"
        USE IT FOR SERVERS WHICH ARE PROCESSING DATA (NOT
        STORING IT)  EG FAST WEB/DATABASE SERVER

    RAID 1	Mirror	: Copy of one drive on the other : 2 drives

    RAID 5  Striping WITH PARITY 

        LINK N DRIVES

        3 MINIMUM TO WORK (32 MAX)

        ONE DRIVE FAILS ==> OTHERS KEEP DATA SAFE!!!

        COST : ONLY LOSE 1/N SPACE !!!  10 DRIVES COST 1/10
                IE 1 DRIVE)

    RAID 6	DOUBLE RAID 5 IE CAN LOSE 2 DRIVES AND STILL FUNCTION

            ((4 DRIVES MIN))

    RAID 1-0  IS FAST RAID 0 BUT MIRROR EACH ARRAY, SO CAN
            ALSO HAVE REDUNDANCY  (SLOW!)

CLUSTERING

    SERVERA
    SERVERB
            SERVERA FAILS ==> SERVER B 'TAKE OVER'

                Services 'fail over' from A to B

            Fix A ==> 'Fail back' from B to A again

    Good for FRONT END SERVERS!!!  EG 24/7 CRITICAL SYSTEMS
        (MUST BE UP)

        
LOAD BALANCING

    

                    1 4 7	BACK END SERVER
    CLIENT ----->	LOAD BALANCER	2 5 8	BACK END SERVER
                    3 6 9	BACK END SERVER
                        
                          (multiple servers
                          = server farm)

SITE REDUNDANCY

    USED IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES EG FIRE, FLOOD ETC

    HOT SITE	** EXPENSIVE !!! ** LIVE COPY OF OUR 
            SITE, FULLY UP AND RUNNING BUT NOBODY
            IS USING IT - IT'S SPARE!!	

    WARM SITE	BUILDING + COMPUTERS WITH SOFTWARE ETC,
            JUST NOT RUNNING 'LIVE'.  DISASTER 1/2 DAYS
            TO GET SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING

    COLD SITE	BARE BUILDING + ELECTRICITY + WATER: 1-2 				WEEKS TO GET UP AND RUNNING IN A DISASTER

POWER

    UPS	UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY
        BATTERY : LAST 30 MINUTES : POWER SERVERS
        IF ELECTRICITY FAILS.

    GENERATOR	HOSPITAL : LONG RUNNING POWER

HOT AISLE / COLD AISLE

    INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS 

        1. HVAC  : HEAT, VENTILATION, AIR CON
        2. SCADA : INDUSTRIAL EG POWER PLANT
               SCADA = CONTROL PANEL TO RUN FACTORY		
            3. DATACENTER

        
            HOT AIR/ COLD AIR TO FLOW EFFICIENTLY			
PATCHING SERVERS

    Server engineer : ensure 'patches' are current
        1) SECURITY ** CRITICAL **
        2) FEATURES : SOFTWARE IMPROVES, ADDS NEW FEATURES		

```

RISK

        NO WEAK PASSWORDS

Threat
    
    Attacker!!!

Risk

    Chance that AN ATTACKER will EXPLOIT (USE) A VULNERABILITY
    (WEAKNESS) TO ATTACK US

    SLE	Single Loss Expectancy : $$$ expected if this
            particular event happens (loss)

    ARO 	Annual Rate of occurrence : HOW OFTEN EXPECT THIS 
            ATTACK

    ALE	= ANNUAL LOSS

    ALE	= SLE X ARO         

            EG $10,000 X TWICE YEAR ==> ANNUAL $20,000

    Mitigate 	Spend money to reduce chances of an attack

    Also

        Accept risk 	do it anyway  
        Transfer risk	insure $$$$ 
        Avoid risk	do something different

```

Authentication

```
Identity Proofing 	sign up with ID eg for passport : verify
            your identity with documents

What you ...

Something you   know		USERNAME / PASSWORD / PIN

        are		BIOMETRIC EG FINGER, RETINA, VOICE

        have		CAC / Smart / ATM card

        do		((Think handwriting recognition : 
                similar with 'way you type'))

Some where you are 		GEOLOCATION BY IP

Multifactor
        Common		SMARTCARD + PIN    (Dual)
                
                Exam : note : password + pin = 1
                    factor (not 2)

OTP One Time PAD/Password	Text message : unique code valid
                one time

    TOTP	Time based: lasts 60 seconds

    HOTP	Hash based : message must match given hash

Password Policies

    LOCAL GPEDIT.MSC

    DOMAIN (GROUP POLICY)		

    Complex : 3 of 4 from   UPPER lower 1234   !@@@##$$%^%^

    Exam : find Group Policy:Computer:Windows:Security:Account

Lockout Policies	

    Lock account after x fails; lock for y minutes (0=forever)

        Reset partial count after z minutes

Default Passwords

    Often come with web devices eg wifi router : ensure
    you change them asap.

    Windows ==> CAN RENAME ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT 

        DISABLE GUEST ACCOUNT

PIV Personal Identity Verification

Smart card is also called 'token based authentication'

```

Biometric login ERRORS!

```
False Acceptance Rate   FAR  ((Also called 'Type II' Error))

    Bad guy gets logged in  (should reject but doesn't)	

    

False Rejection

False Negative		BAD FILE  : NOT FLAGGED AS VIRUS	

```

Technologies to log you in to a computer system

```
Kerberos 

    Keeps Windows servers secure!!!  ((keeps Active Directory
        secure!!!)

    When you log in, Kerberos ISSUE YOU WITH A 'TOKEN'

    When you want access to a file you present this TOKEN

        Check : ACL : List of users ==> DO YOU HAVE 						PERMISSION ON THIS FILE?

                ACL = ACCESS CONTROL LIST
        
              : ACE : fine permissions (ACCESS CONTROL ENTRY)

                FULL CONTROL	SET PERMISSIONS
                MODIFY		CHANGE/DELETE
                READ		VIEW ONLY
                EXECUTE
                WRITE		CREATE ONLY		
                LIST FOLDERS														

        Note : Clocks must be synchronised within 5 minutes!

    Kerberos : Port 88 !!!

LDAP
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

        
    Active Directory is BUILT ON LDAP!!!

    Names look like

    CN(COMMON NAME)=Melinda Gates,OU=Managers, OU=Employees,
        DC=phil,DC=local

    OU = FOLDER (ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT)

    LDAP PORT = 389
    RDP  PORT = 3389

                ((X.500 IS OLD))
    LDAP Secure : Encrypted

SSO Single Sign On

    Log in once, access to multiple sites

    
Companies Trusting Each Other

    Trust : One company trusts another 

    Transitive Trust

        A ==> B  and B ==> C

        then

        A  ==         ==>  C

ADFS Federation Services

    Permits SINGLE SIGN ON BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES

             ((use certificates))
        ==============>ADFS============>
    COMPANY A				COMPANY B

SAML : language which enables SINGLE SIGN ON (XML LANGUAGE)

```

VPN Authentication (remote dial in)

```
PAP		Plain text : don't use!

CHAP		Don't use!

MS-CHAP2	Just OK! Minimum.	

EAP-TLS		Most secure : EAP (Shell) with TLS (Encryption)

        Secure : Certificates ON BOTH SERVER AND CLIENT

PEAP		Protected EAP
        
        Certificate on SERVER; Password on Client

```

RADIUS

```
Client ==> dial in 					ACTIVE
       RAS dial-in  <---------RADIUS SERVER ------->

To Talk To The Internet We Need :

```
1. IP		
2. MASK
3. GATEWAY
4. DNS

IP => ADDRESS OF PC			192.168.10.20

MASK ==> WHICH NETWORK WE ARE ON	
                255.    255.     255.     0
                1111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
                CIDR /24 = NUMBER OF 1'S IN MASK
                    NETWORK IS 192.168.10.0

GATEWAY ==> TO INTERNET

DNS : MAP NAME TO IP	

```

SUBNET MASK IS A CHOICE THAT HUMANS MAKE TO DETERMINE SIZE OF YOUR NETWORK

```
CLASS C MASK /24	LIMITATION : 2 POWER 8 = 256 COMPUTERS MAX!
      B      /16

FIREWALL

```
HOST-BASED : ONE PC

NETWORK BASED : ALL PCS (IE ON ROUTER)

FIREWALLL RULE : BLOCK/ALLOW IP TRAFFIC

FIREWALL : BLOCK BY

    1. IP
    2. PORT
    3. PROGRAM
    4. PROTOCOL : TCP OR UDP

IMPLICIT DENY : LAST RULE = BLOCK ALL TRAFFIC NOT MATCHED

```

Types Of Firewall

```
Layer 3
    BLOCK BY IP ONLY!
    "STATELESS" FIREWALL  

Layer 4
    AWARE OF 'FLOW' OF TCP TRAFFIC (SEQUENCE 1,2,3,4...)
    "STATEFUL" FIREWAL

Layer 7  ** SLOW YOUR SYSTEM DOWN!!! ***

    DEEP PACKET INSPECTION		ANALYSE FILES EG INSIDE ZIP

```

NAC NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL

```
Force clients to become COMPLIANT before they JOIN YOUR NETWORK

CHECK   1) Updates
    2) AV
    3) Firewall ON

FAIL ==> PUT PC TO QUARANTINE : FORCE PC TO 'HEAL' & GET UPDATES

```

NAT AND PAT

```
NAT can allow computers with PRIVATE IP to reach PUBLIC INTERNET

Swap our PRIVATE IP for the PUBLIC IP of our ROUTER

    (( add in a high port number so can get a reply eg 58885 ))

NAT = PAT  Network / Port address translation

    PAT = MANY PORTS
    NAT = ONE PORT  ( LOOSELY CALLED PAT/NAT ANYWAY)

```

Chapter 4

IDS	Intrusion DETECTION

    HIDS  on one computer (HOST) only 
    NIDS  on firewall : PROTECT WHOLE NETWORK

    Passive : ALERTS ONLY!  (help! we are under attack!!!)
    
IPS	Intrusion PREVENTION

    HIPS/NIPS

    Active : take action eg block firewall

Wireshark = Packet Sniffer = NETWORK PROTOCOL ANALYSER!!!!

```

Ways to DETECT AN ATTACK

```
1. Signature Based

    EVERY BAD VIRUS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT : TAKE IT'S HASH!!!

    SCAN OUR COMPUTER ETC FOR ALL GOOD FILES : IF ANY MATCH
    HASH OF A VIRUS ==> WE ALERT!!!!

2. Anomaly Based 

    'Baseline' graph of GOOD BEHAVIOUR EG CPU, RAM, NETWORK

    ==> VIRUS : OFTEN SHOW AS INCREASED CPU ETC : Trigger
                    an alert

        ==> ANOMALY CHECKS AGAINST A GOOD BASELINE GRAPH!!

3. Behaviour Based  ** NOT SO RELIABLE (FALSE POSITIVES!!)

    Creates RULES : if a virus triggers a rule we get an 
            alert eg a certain process running on 
            our PC

    HEURISTIC = REAL TIME SCANNING   (SLOW PC!)

```

Detecting attacks

                CLIENT : USER/PASSWORD

EAP-TLS		best		CERTIFICATES : BOTH ON SERVER
                AND CLIENT : ULTRA-SECURE

```

Mobile Encryption

```
ECC Elliptic Curve Cryptography : SMALL, FAST ==> GOOD FOR MOBILE
                    PHONE ENCRYPTION!!!

```

Captive Portal : Forces you to read and accept terms and conditions before
connect to free wifi

Secure WIFI

```
1) MAC filtering ==> a LOT OF WORK!!!  (only connect if your MAC 
                        matches)

2) Turn down POWER!

3) ??? not very good ??? ==>  EXAM : OK ANSWER : DISABLE SSID
                    BROADCAST

    SSID ==> Name of WIFI EG FreeHotelWIFI

    POSSIBLE : DISABLE BROADCAST OF SSID
        
        (( PHONE ==> SEE 'UNNAMED NETWORK'))

```

EXAM : SECURE WIFI
1) ENCRYPTION : BEST (WEP HACKED, WPA, WPA2)
2) MAC FILTER : GOOD : TONS OF WORK
3) POWER LOW : GOOD
4) DISABLE SSID BROADCAST : JUST OK

1) Hello : I'm going to send you data 2) Server : OK 3) Client : Done

```
SYN FLOOD : Send lots of 'hello' (stage 1) requests ONLY
    Server : reserve space for conversations which never happen

```

Flood guard : watches for and prevents flood attacks (DOS flood)

Port Scan	Scanning network for all OPEN PORTS (free online port scan)	*** NOTE : THIS IS SEEN AS AN ATTACK **

XMAS Attack	Port Scan ==> ALL OF THE POSSIBLE 'FLAGS' SET TO 'HIGH' (1)
TO PROVOKE A RESPONSE

MITM Man In The Middle

```
Client			Bad Router 		Server

        Can be used 
        1) Eavesdrop : LISTEN (Passive)
        2) Alter packets in some way
                (Active)

Prevent : HTTPS Scanning (part of UTM Threat Management)

```

Session Hijack

```
Client---------------Bad Router----------------Server

    Bad router can actually 'take over' session

             Bad Router----------------Server

    Server THINKS STILL TALKING TO CLIENT BUT IS NOT: 
        BAD ROUTER IS IMPERSONATING AND HAS TAKEN
        OVER THE SESSION

```

Session Replay Attack

```
Valid session is copied and played back later

Client---------------Bad Router---------------Server

    later on Bad Router 'replay' same packets back to server
    to create a 'dummy' connection.

Mitigate using TIMESTAMPS

```

Password attack
Brute force	0000 through 9999 every combination in turn
STOP : using Account Lockout Policy
Dictionary attack	using obvious dictionary words

Birthday attack
TWO FILES CAN HAVE SAME HASH : USE THIS TO GET PAST OUR 'HASHING'	PROOF THAT A FILE HAS NOT CHANGED

Rainbow Table
Bad guys collect tables of hashes
Password	Hash
MyPass23	1234324hj5g324hj5g324g
MyPass24	asdf654asd7f54asd7f4as
MyPass25	1234324hj5g324hj5g324g

DNS Map NAME to IP

DNS Poison : FAKE DNS Records

DNS Pharming attack : FAKE DNS SERVER or CORRUPT 'HOSTS' RECORD ON ONE PC
Hosts ==> NOT USED NOW!!!
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

ARP	Address Resolution Protocol	IP to MAC conversion
arp -a

ARP Poison
Fake/change some ARP data to cause trouble

Typo Squatting

```
    Gooogle.com
    Amazone.com     MIS-SPELLING OF COMMON SITES : PEOPLE BUY
            DOMAIN NAME THEN SELL TO CORRECT OWNER FOR
            LOTS OF MONEY

```

URL Hijacking
Buy domain names of companies and 'sit on them'. Force
legitimate company to pay us lots of money to sell them
back their own domain name

Watering Hole	Attacks on sites which are very popular and lots of people
hanging around eg social media sites

Zero Day	Brand new software : Hackers discover weakness : exploit it
before good guys get a fix

Cookie	Text file : tracking your browsing

LSO Flash Cookie DON'T USE FLASH ! But in the exam!!!
Flash Cookie = LSO Locally Shared Object

Errors	Programmer error ==> get wrong answer!!! (eg Interest Rate
is wrong)

Exceptions	SYSTEM CRASH!!!!
Handled : sorted internally
Unhandled : PROGRAM CRASHES!!

Application Attack
Main APPLICATIONS we are concerned with are
1) HTTP/HTTPS WEB SERVER!!!
LINUX : FREE 'APACHE' WEBSITE
WINDOWS : FREE : IIS INTERNET INFORMATION
SERVICES
2) DATABASE SERVER
3) EXCHANGE EMAIL ETC

Injection Attacks

```
Website : FORM TO COLLECT INFORMATION
      eg
        name..........  dob........  
        address.........

                SUBMIT

It's possible to INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING TEXT, SUBMIT CODE INSTEAD!!!
    
SQL
    REGULAR SQL : SELECT * FROM USERS ...

    FORM : Instead of submitting name, submit SQL code instead.
    
LDAP	
XML

```

Input Validation

```
Check for 'strange' characters like \\ / < > ' "   etc in fields

```

Buffer Overflow Attack

```
Buffer 
    Temporary data store to hold information when network
    is slow : waiting for data to either send or receive

    Buffer data is stored in RAM of COMPUTER!

    Buffer Overflow attack ==> PUSH GOOD DATA OUT OF BUFFER,
        POSSIBLY GET ACCESS TO AREAS OF RAM NEXT TO 
        THE BUFFER WHICH NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

```

XSS Cross Site Scripting

```
Hack in to one website and from there, hack into another	

```

Folder Traversal Attack

```
Reach one folder : from there, navigate and reach another folder

```

XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery

```
Hack a website but ALREADY LOGGED IN ==> YOU HAVE MORE POWER
    TO DO MORE DAMAGE WHEN YOU HACK IN

```

Types of testing

```
Black Box		Input/Output ONLY!

White Box		Know code : test to break code of program!

Grey Box		Some knowledge

Alpha 			FIRST EARLY RELEASE

Beta			NEAR TO PERFECT : GIVE AWAY FOR FREE: 
            IRON OUT ALL THE BUGS

Unit			Small piece of code !  Test that only

Integration		Join UNITS together

System			Build final product and test

Regression		Fix bugs BUT RE-TEST PRODUCT SO NEW ERRORS
            ARE NOT INTRODUCED

Fuzz Testing		THROWING RANDOM DATA AT OUR APPLICATION
            TO SEE IF IT CATCHES ALL ERRORS, EVEN
            FROM RANDOM RUBBISH

```

Types of hacking

```
Black hat		BAD GUY

White hat		ETHICAL GOOD GUY

Grey hat		Dubious eg HACKTIVIST TO DISPLAY A LOGO

Blue hat		Hack you on request (not for money)	

```

Command Line

```
CD		Change directory	
CD..		go up one level
CD\\		go to ROOT LEVEL
DIR		list directories
                ls = LIST (LINUX SAME COMMAND)
MD		Make Directory/Folder
RD		Remove Directory

```

Failure and Recovery

```
MTBF		Mean Time Between Failures

        Light bulb : last 100,000 hours
        MTBF = 100,000 HOURS !!! RELIABLE!!!
        BIGGER VALUE IS BETTER
        ((USE WITH HARD DRIVE))
            
            MTTF mean time TO FAIL  (once)

MTTR

        Mean Time To Repair

        Hard drive fails : RAID ==> fix immediately!

            replace drive .. done!!!  (RAID1, RAID5)

                : NO RAID!!!  BUILD SERVER FROM
                    SCRATCH + RESTORE BACKUP
                    + RE-TEST ETC

                2 TO 3 DAYS!!!

```

Enemy techniques for scanning

```
Footprinting		LEGAL MEANS TO GET DATA ON PEOPLE AND 				COMPANIES.  WE ALL LEAVE A 'FOOTPRINT' ONLINE
            EG SOCIAL MEDIA, WEBSITES ETC

Fingerprinting		NON-LEGAL MEANS TO GET INFO EG HOSTS/NETWORK
            IPS OF COMPUTERS IN A COMPANY.  Scan network
            illegally to find out servers, printers,
            users etc  ==> getting ready to attack

Banner Grabbing		Sending requests to websites etc : OBSERVE
            HEADER INFORMATION COMING BACK ==> find 
            out eg server running Apache + version

            curl  ==> same as http:// 

APT Advanced Persistent Threat

    Persistent malware can be installed on a remote system
    and cause trouble over months or even years ==> Advanced
    Persistent Threat

Credentialed Scan ==> you are logged in when performing a scan

            RESTORE 1) FULL BACKUP 2) DIFFERENTIAL

```

Encryption

Stream vs Block Cipher
Stream cipher = 1 bit at a time , fast
Block cipher = much stronger (in blocks)
but slower

Email Encryption : PGP	Pretty Good Privacy
S/MIME
** Exam : Both used EMAIL ENCRYPTION

Key Stretch	Short passwords : add to make them longer

XMAS DAY ATTACK : PORT SCAN ATTACK BUT ALL 'flags' set to '1' (high) to
provoke some sort of response

Lab Work

Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application

Layer 1 : Physical

Anything you can touch!

Cabling

```
Copper

    UTP    Unshielded Twisted Pair
    STP    Shielded Twisted Pair
    Plenum    Fire rated

Copper : COAX cables

    THICKNET    ORIGINAL     10Mbps

        10BASE5        5 ==> 500M  
        RG8

    THINNET        TV TODAY

        10BASE2        2==> 200M  (185M)
        RG58
        

Fiber
    Monomode    Pure laser light, expensive, 50km

    Multimode    Cheap LED light, 2km

                LAN    Local
                WAN    Wide area  (Monomode laser)
                MAN    Metropolitan (Multimode)
                CAN    Campus (Multimode)
                PAN    Personal (Bluetooth)

```

Layer 1 : Devices

```
Hub
    Broadcast all on all ports

Repeater
    100m max Ethernet : use repeater to extend to 200m

```

Layer 2

```
LAN LAYER

PC AND SWITCHES COMMUNICATE

How???
    Address of each machine ==> MAC ADDRESS

        IPCONFIG /ALL ==> 'Physical address'
                       (Hardware)

    Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 60-67-20-78-0B-C6

What 'protocol' do we use to send data?

    Ethernet!!!

    Ethernet 'frame' is packet of data

| destination mac | source mac | data | CRC Error check |

    
Switch will be the central point of our network
    
    Analyse all packets
    Build table
    PORT     MAC
    1    ...
    2    ...
    3    ...

    Switch create 'virtual circuit' between computers
        so transfer is very quick eg 1Gbps

```

Summary
Layer 1 : Cabling, Hub, Repeater ==> raw electricity
Layer 2 : Switch : MAC Address, Data sent using ETHERNET as carrier

Layer 3 : Networking layer

```
IP Address (assigned in software)

    Private
        4 ranges
            Class A        10.x.y.z
            Class B        172.16.x.y - 172.31.x.y
            Class C        192.168.x.y

            APIPA          169.254.x.y
                    (issued when DHCP broken)
                                    

                    ((DHCP ==> assign IP 

```

address
to computers when they
start))

```
    Public 
        (( Google 'what is my IP' ))

            80.187.110.102

        All share same PUBLIC IP

            Given to us by ISP Internet Service 

```

Provider

```
        All machines share this same 'Gateway' address

            Is class A/B/C?  INSPECT FIRST number of IP

        First number is 

        Class A Range    1-126
        Loopback     127.0.0.1
        Class B Range    128-191
        Class C Range    192-223
        Class D Range    224-239
        Class E Range    240-255

        How do we get these numbers?

        Binary

        128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
        1    0   0   0   0  0  0  0   ==> 128
        1    1   0   0   0  0  0  0   ==> 192
        1    1   1   0   0  0  0  0   ==> 128+64+32=224
        1    1   1   1   0  0  0  0   ==> 224 + 16 = 240
        
        
        Class A, B, C regular everyday computing
        Class D ==> Multicast ==> Push out large files
            or videos to network (eg .WIM image)

        Class E : research

```

Layer 3 : Routing

```
Second purpose of LAYER 3 is to CREATE EFFICIENT ROUTES 
        ACROSS THE INTERNET

    = 'ROUTING'

RIP = Routing Internet Protocol

    Basic : Router share ALL OF ITS KNOWN INFORMATION
            EVERY 30 SECONDS!  (BROADCAST TO ALL)

EIGRP ==> CISCO upgrade to RIP

    Same but ONLY SEND DATA IF A CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE; 
        OTHERWISE SILENT!!

RIP and EIGRP

    Distance around world measured in

        HOPS  (Call this a 'metric' which we can measure)

```

Layer 4 : Transport layer

```
So far
    1    Physical 
    2    Ethernet, Switch, MAC
    3    IP : Private and Public

        IP Packet :  Source IP, Destination IP, Data
            

        Routing : RIP and EIGRP

What is lacking in layer 3???

    We don't know if our data has arrived!

TCP    checking BUT SLOW!!!  (Better slow data than no data!!!)

    Two fields
    1. Sequence SEQ
    2. Acknowledge ACK

    SEQ : COUNT SENT PACKETS 1,2,3,4,5
    ACK : RECEIVER SENDS BACK WHAT ARRIVED EG 1,2,4,5

    SENDER : MISSING ACK ON PACKET 3 SO RESEND

    3-way handshake 
        Client : Hey, are you ready to receive?
        Server : yes
        Client : OK let's begin         
        

UDP    Streaming radio ==> use UDP - NO CHECKING!!!

    
TCP     SLOW, CHECKING        Connection-Oriented
UDP     FAST, NO CHECKING     Connectionless

Firewall
    IP            StateLESS
    TCP            StateFUL
    UDP            StateLESS

```

Layer 5

```
Create, manage, terminate 'session'

    Session = flow of data eg skype, Youtube, Messenger, email

```

Layer 6 : Presentation

```
Compress
    Large .WAV   ==> small .MP3
          .WMV             .MP4
          .RAW             .jpg

Encrypt    

```

Layer 7 Application

```
eg Skype, Outlook ==> request access to network

```

Network Protocols

FTP File Transfer Protocol

```
PLAIN TEXT : NOT SECURE

20/21

Encrypted versions

    SFTP
    FTPS

```

Bit-torrent

```
Split large file into SEEDS

Seed sent to clients : clients can now even send seeds to 
        other clients on internet!!!

De-centralised model!!!    ((Win 10 updates use this!!!))

```

Telnet

```
23
Plain text commands : old 

```

SSH
22
Encrypted Telnet

Email

```
OUT : Send

    SMTP    25    Simple Mail Transfer

Assign IP to computer
Port 67/8

TFTP Copy files on LAN (Trivial FTP)
Port 69

KERBEROS
Encrypt data in Active Directory
SSO also

NETBIOS
Old fashioned 'NETWORKING WITH HOSTNAME '

```
HOSTNAME = NAME OF PC EG PC01
Port 137-139

        VIEW WITH NBTSTAT -n
                      -c

```

SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol
used to TRACK IF DEVICES ARE UP AND RUNNING

```
    HEARTBEAT EVERY EG 30 SECONDS 'I AM ALIVE'

    ALSO STATS EG THROUGHPUT 100MB LAST HOUR

SNMPv3  ==> allow encryption!
Port 161-162

```

LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
Used for ACTIVE DIRECTORY!
CN="PHIL",OU="USERS",DC="MYDOMAIN",DC="COM"
Port 389

RDP Remote Desktop Protocol
Log in to server
Port 3389

VPN Virtual Private Network

```
Dial up ==> PPP create connection (layer 2)

Encrypt 'tunnel' across INTERNET  

    LAN - LAN            Permanent, Tunnel Mode

    Home (laptop) ==> dial in to - LAN    Temp, Transport Mode

4 encryption methods

    PPTP    1723        Old, Point-to-point
    
    L2TP    1701        Good, strong, certificates
                IPSEC (built-in IP encryption)
    
    SSTP    443        VPN OVER HTTPS = SSL / TLS

                VPN over WEB!!!

    IKEV2    500, 4500    Latest, strong, certificates
                IPSEC (built-in IP encryption)

                VPN Reconnect : if on wifi/4g 
                and it 'drops' out, then can 
                reconnect without authentication

```

VLAN Virtual LAN

```
Switch

    Ports
    1    2    3    4    5    6
    VLAN01 VLAN01  VLAN01    VLAN02 
    PC01   PC02    PC03     PC04   
    ===================    =================

    company A         company B

    TRAFFIC CONFINED    
    TO VLAN01 COMPUTERS
    ONLY (ISOLATED VLAN)    

    LEGALLY CAN ISOLATE TWO COMPANIES : TWO 'VIRTUAL' LANS
        ON OUR SWITCH

    Ethernet ==> 'Tag' every packet  (802.1q)

```

Encryption

```
Cryptography = Science Of Encryption

Plain text                        Cipher Text
                            (encrypted)

        Algorithm    Key(user)   Key (system)
                        'salt'

        FIXED        Unique        Second password
                        Random, unique

        WEP2 with       WIFI KEY        
        AES encryption

```

3 types of encryption

```
Symmetric
Asymmetric
Hashing

```

Symmetric

```
FAST!
ONE KEY (think WIFI!)
also "Shared key"
also "reversible"

AES    (exam, good answer)
older    DES, 3DES, RC4, Blowfish, Twofish

Summary : one key both ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT. Fast. AES.

    <<older WPA also symmetric : Used TKIP encryption>>

Session key = Symmetric key lasting 10 minutes (eg web 'session')

```

Asymmetric = PKI Public Key Encryption

```
2 Keys

    PRIVATE & PUBLIC KEY

Slow 

Super strong !!!  (Certificates can last 30 years!!!))

    Either key can ENCRYPT : Other must decrypt!

Encryption Example

    Bob send Paul some encrypted data

    1)  Paul send to Bob his PUBLIC KEY (anyone can have
                your public key)

    2) Bob use Paul's PUBLIC KEY TO ENCRYPT THE DATA

    3) Send encrypted file to Paul

    4) Paul : read with PAUL'S PRIVATE KEY

        done!!!

Verifying Sender's Identity

    Goal : ensure email sender is GENUINE

    Commander : send bulk email

    1) Encrypt email with PRIVATE KEY of commander
    2) Send email
    3) Troops : UNLOCK WITH PUBLIC KEY of commander 
        ==> know it's genuine

PKI : Asymmetric : SUPER STRONG BUT SUPER SLOW!!!  2 keys public/
        private

```

Hashing

```
Integrity : ENSURE DATA HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL

MD5
SHA1

Hashing : summary : checks if file has changed (Integrity)

Using hashing today

    Passwords
        mysecretpassword

    Hashing ==> also called 'ONE WAY ENCRYPTION'

        ((proven cannot reverse this))

    Bad guys ==> COLLECT 'RAINBOW TABLES' OF UP TO 50GB OR
        MORE OF PASSWORDS AND THEIR HASH

```

Signature

```
Goal of 'signing' a document is two fold

    1) Prove who created it  "Publisher"

    2) Prove file has not changed (integrity)

1. Take your file

2. Hash your file

3. With your PRIVATE KEY, ENCRYPT JUST THE 'HASH'!

    SIGNATURE OF FILE = ENCRYPTED HASH OF FILE !!!

At run time we must VERIFY THE SIGNATURE

    
1. Use PUBLIC KEY OF PUBLISHER (CREATOR OF FILE) to 
    DECRYPT THE HASH

2. Re-hash original file and compare this hash with the
    decrypted hash : should match

    MYFILE.DOC   ==>   HASH   =>    ENCRYPTED HASH

    CHECK
    
    1.         HASH    <<<==    ENCRYPTED HASH

    2. MYFILE.DOC ==> HASH    

```

Darill Gibson Book

Chapter 1

C Confidentiality = Encryption

I Integrity = Data has not changed

A Availability = Data can be used

A Authentication = LOG IN

A Authorisation = GRANTED ACCESS / PERMISSION TO A FILE

A Accounting = LOGGING WHO DID WHAT, WHEN

Authentication

```
Credentials

    Log in User/Password

```


Use of the 'MAC' word

```
1. MAC address
2. MAC Mandatory Access Control (Clearance)  CLASSIFY FILE
            WITH 'TOP SECRET'
3. (H) MAC  Hash a message   Hash based message : verify message
            intact

```

PKI use of Certificates

```
CERTIFICATE is a digital container to hold you 'key'

    PUBLIC CERTIFICATES ONLINE EG VERISIGN

SIGNATURE ==> VALIDATE A FILE THAT IT'S GENUNINE

    HASH ==> VERIFY FILE HAS NOT CHANGED

    SIGNATURE ==> VERIFIES 1) FILE HAS NOT CHANGED (HASH)
                   2) ID OF SENDER/PUBLISHER/OWNER
                    (PUBLIC/PRIVATE PAIR)

        = NON-REPUDIATION which means we can't deny
            that something happened.

           EG DATABASE FILE : SIGNED : PROVE IN COURT 
            OF LAW IT WASN'T TAMPERED WITH.

```

Availability

```
Is data available?

Redundancy : If a system fails, we have procedures in place
        to fix this quickly

Fault tolerance : can cope with a failure and still keep operating

RAID 

    RAID 0        Striping    No redundancy but FAST!!
            2 drives    Use in WEB SERVER / 
                    DATABASE SERVER

Load balancing

    CLIENT ==> LOAD BALANCER  ==>   SERVER FARM    A/B/C/D/E

        round robin requests to A/B/C/D/E in turn

Site redundancy (hot/warm/cold site)

    Hot site : full power + computers ready to go ** EXPENSIVE

    Warm site : building + devices off 

    Cold site : building only : bare building + electrical 
                    power

Backup

UPS    Uninterruptible Power supply : battery lasting 30 minutes

Single Point Of Failure : one critical component that, if
    fails, we have no service

HVAC system : 

    Heating, Ventilation, Air Con

Patching 
    keeping system up to date

Fail safe        Power saw, two hands to power on

Fail open        Door : power out ==> door swing open
            
Fail secure/shut    Door : power out ==> door remain locked

Risk

```
Vulnerability    weakness in our system

    Misconfiguring server
    Lack of patching (updates)
    Firewall OPEN PORTS
    Permissions (access control) not monitored
    Back door : HACK CREATED BY PROGRAMMER TO LOG IN 
        BYPASS ALL SECURITY        
    Lack of fire suppression
    Lack of PHYSICAL SECURITY EG GUARD, BARRIER ETC
    
Threat : something malicious which wants to attack

    Insider threat (malicious employee)
    Malware
    Virus
    Worm
    

Risk is Chance that a THREAT will EXPLOIT (USE) A VULNERABILITY
        TO ATTACK YOU

What to do with Risk!!!

    Mitigate ==> REDUCE RISK (wear HIGH VIS VEST)

    Accept risk : do it anyway!

    Transfer risk : pay insurer

    Avoid risk : do something completely different

Impact = HOW MUCH DAMAGE WILL BE CAUSED!!!

    Issue : Virus hits system

    SLE    Single Loss Expectancy        $10,000

    ARO    Annual Rate Of Occurrence    2

    ALE    Annual Loss Expectancy

        ALE = SLE X ARO  = 10000 X 2  = $20,000

```

Identity & Authentication

```
Something you ...

    know        User/password/PIN

    are        Biometric eg fingerprint, retina scan

    have        CAC Card  (Token based authentication)

    do        way you type!!!

Some WHERE YOU ARE    geolocation of IP

    

Password policy

    Complex password ==> UPPER + lower + 1234 + !@#$

        Windows ==> 3 out 4 acceptable (not all 4)

        (view in Group Policy / GPEDIT.MSC which is
            managing ONE COMPUTER)
            

Lockout policy

    Fail to log in ==> lock your account after x fails

        Duration of lockout : 0 minutes ==> for ever!
                (admin has to unlock)

Default Passwords

    !!! care !!! Many internet devices COME WITH BUILT-IN
    DEFAULT USER AND PASSWORD WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON THE 

```

INTERNET

```
        Care ! Change quickly !

```

Smart cards (something you have)

```
Chip : contain certificate

    ((Token based authentication : granted TOKEN when you
        log in))

CAC

PIV card

```

Multifactor

```
Smartcard (token)      1 factor    (you have)
PIN            1 factor    (you know)

```

One Time Password

```
OTP    one time password (eg text to your phone)

TOTP    time based : expire after 2 minutes

HOTP    hash based : can only use one time 
    
        file    +   1        
        file    +   2  

```

Biometric

```
False positive        flags eg as VIRUS but it's a good file

False negative        Virus which gets through

Login
    False Acceptance : Type 2 error : let unauthorised through
        FAR False Acceptance Rate

    False Rejection : Valid person rejected

```

Authentication Services

```
Kerberos
    
    Active Directory is SECURED WITH KERBEROS

    Log in : get a TOKEN.

        Use this token when want access to a file : 
        present token.

        ACL Access Control List ==> check

            1) ARE YOU ON THE LIST?

            2) ACE ENTRY : DO YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL/
                MODIFY/READ/WRITE ETC ???

    ((All computers must be within 5 minutes of each other))

LDAP
    
    LDAPS = Secure version

SSO Single Sign On

    Forest ==> GROUP OF DOMAINS  EG Microsoft.com bought
            msn.com, skype.com, hotmail.com

    Trust ==> BETWEEN DOMAINS

        Transitive == 'THROUGH' TRUST

            A==>B  B==>C  so now A==>B==>C     

    Federation = GROUP OF COMPANIES WHICH TRUST EACH OTHER

        COMPANYA:USER:JOE  ==> LOG IN AND GAIN ACCESS 
            TO COMPANYB

            (VIEW USER:JOE AS read only user in
                CompanyB)

    SAML ==> XML language to enable SSO between companies

Ways to Authenticate REMOTELY INTO YOUR SYSTEM

```
RAS = Remote Access Service = dialing remotely into your system

    RAS can involve
        1) Dialing to a phone number
        2) Dialing to an IP Address

    On top then can create a VPN with encryption

Client ==> RAS Server ==>  RADIUS server  ==> Active Directory  
               (authenticate 
                  with Active
               Directory)

      RAS1
      RAS2
      RAS3  (many RAS   (only 1 RADIUS
         servers)     server)

```

Authentication Types

```
PAP    Plain Text : DO NOT USE!!!

Chap    Not quite as bad as PAP but still - avoid using

MS-Chap2 : Microsoft : OK to use (passwords)

EAP-TLS  : uses CERTIFICATES ON CLIENT and SERVER (both machines)

PEAP     : Protected EAP : Good as CERTIFICATE ON SERVER;
        password for user on client

LEAP : Lightweight EAP : Cisco : DO NOT USE!  (Vulnerabilities)

```

Advanced Authentication Types for VPN

```
RADIUS

    CLIENT==>RAS DIAL-IN SERVER==>  RADIUS ==>  AD BACK END    

    Job of RADIUS is to verify user credentials with 
        Active Directory

DIAMETER

    Improved version of RADIUS (pun : DIAMETER is twice length
                    of RADIUS of a circle...!)

TACACS+    : best of these 3 (better than RADIUS or DIAMETER)

    full encryption of authentication traffic

Chapter 2

Types of control to STOP INCIDENTS!!!

```
Technical Control
    Using technology eg 

        Firewall : block IP traffic

        IDS Intrusion Detection  : Alert eg email

            NIDS Network Intrusion (for whole network)
            HIDS Host based intrusion (for one server)    

        IPS Intrusion Prevention : Take action eg
            Temporarily stop traffic getting into 
            network

            NIPS    : whole network 
            HIPS    : one HOST (SERVER)

        Encryption

        Antivirus

        Motion detection camera

Management Control

    Create POLICIES 

        AUP Acceptable Use
        Password policy
        Lockout policy
        Disaster recovery policy
        Data protection policy
        ...

    Auditing : CHECK IF POLICIES BEING USED!!!

        Policy Enforcement : ensure people DOING WHAT
            POLICY ASKS

    Risk : 
        1) Risk Assessment
        2) Monetarise (calculate how much money to 
                spend on reducing risk)
        3) Mitigate : take action : reduce risk

    Vulnerability Assessment

        Pay 'Ethical Hacker' (White Hat Hacker) to 
        scan your systems for weaknesses
            
            FIREWALL
                OPEN PORTS
                ACL : ACCESS RULES / LISTS
            PHYSICAL : DOORS, CAMERAS, ETC...
            SOFTWARE : HACKABLE
            RUNNING SERVICES : UNNECESSARY (TURN OFF)

    Penetration Testing

        Pay 'Ethical Hacker' to ACTUALLY TRY AND HACK
        IN TO YOUR SYSTEM

            ==> Hacker, if break in, would prove 
            the 'exploit to a point 

        ACTUALLY BREAK IN TO YOUR SYSTEM

Operational Control

    Day-to-day implementation of policies etc advised
        by management

    Clean desk policy : no passwords or data visible overnight

    Change Management

        Authorised, approved changes

        1. Cost analysis
        2. Risk analysis => can anything go wrong?
        3. Backup??? ==> Roll back if necessary
        4. Approval and sign off
        
    Configuration Management

        Ensuring if our machine fails eg server, router,
        switch ==> we have good mechanism for restoring
        all correct settings (configuration)

        Mistake ==> restore to correct also

                2. Security : login etc 
                    Success = good login
                    Failure (lots of them)
                    indicate hacker activity

    Video : detect AFTER if something happened

Corrective Controls

    IPS Intrusion Prevention (active control)
        TAKE ACTION EG PUT ATTACKER MACHINE ON 
            SEPARATE NETWORK (USE DHCP)

    Backup : can restore if attacked

Deterrent

    Warning signs eg Building, at Logon

    Video cameras

    etc

    Just a clear sign to enemy : don't attack

Compensating Control

    If primary mechanism not working, then do x instead

    eg Smart cards not working ==> instead get ONE TIME 
            PASSWORD TO LOG IN

```

Physical Control

```
Cipher Lock on door = KEYPAD

Proximity Card 

Tailgating : following someone through secure door

    Mantrap : force people one by one

Least privilege : min access to do your job

Group Policy

    Mechanism for CENTRALLY MANAGING
        USERS, GROUPS, COMPUTERS, PRINTERS
        and all settings eg centrally applied 
        password settings for our 'domain'

    
    Domain ==> Server Manager / Admin Tools

        Default Domain Policy ==> ENTIRE COMPANY

        Move jobs ==> remove from old role, add to new
                 permissions are set

    Groups     

Rule Based Access

    Cuts through permissions

    Restricting access to all based on different criteria

        eg Downtime during night == > no user can log
        on midnight to 4am  RULE!!

    Firewall : IP TRAFFIC BLOCKED EG PORT 21 FTP BLOCKED

    
Discretionary Access  DACL

    Discretion ==> permission to choose

    DACL : local admin has full rights to set permissions
        on folders as see fit to do.

        NTFS PERMISSIONS

            FULL CONTROL    Set permission    
            MODIFY        change/delete file

            LIST FOLDERS    traverse folder path

        SID = security ID  

        RID = relative ID (domain)

        GUID = domain ID  

MAC Mandatory Access Control

    Government Classified Documents
        Top secret, secret, restricted, 
            confidential, unclassified

Sending data

    To send data we need

    1) IP Address

    2) Port which is a channel to reach this IP

Router / Firewall

```
In this course we have 2 ACL

1) Windows - each folder has an ACL with users and permissions

2) Firewall - each firewall will have an ACCESS CONTROL LIST

    TO ALLOW OR DENY IP TRAFFIC

Firewalls BLOCK TRAFFIC BY

    1)    IP

    2)    PORT

    3)    PROGRAM eg Skype

    4)    PROTOCOL EITHER TCP / UDP

            ui.linksys.com   100 routers to log into!

Implicit Deny

    a door is LOCKED BY DEFAULT!

    Users are LOCKED OUT BY ASSUMPTION (IMPLICIT DENY)
    unless granted EXPLICIT ACCESS

Host-based firewall : on ONE PC EG WINDOWS FIREWALL

Network based : ON GATEWAY DEVICE :PROTECTS WHOLE LAN

Firewall rule looks like

    PERMIT/DENY    SOURCE     DESTINATION  PORT     PROTOCOL

```

tcp/udp/ip=both

```
    DENY        ANY    ANY         ALL     IP
           (LAST RULE = DENY ALL = IMPLICIT DENY)    

DMZ

    A DMZ (DE-MILITARIZED ZONE) IS A TERM FOR AN AREA BETWEEN
        2 ARMIES.

    In networking, a DMZ is an area OUTSIDE OUR LAN
        to host a PUBLIC FACING WEB SERVER

    DMZ = PERIMITER NETWORK = SCREENED SUBNET

        Even if hacker hacks in, limited damage is done

DMZ can host a 'Web site' or a 'Web Application' (much 
        the same thing)

    WAF = Web Application Firewall : protect our web app!

```

Firewall types

```
Layer 3        simple firewall : block by IP

        "stateless" firewall : INSPECTS EACH PACKET
            INDIVIDUALLY : unware of 'STATE' OR 'FLOW'
            OF PACKETS

Layer 4        "stateful" firewall : AWARE OF FLOW OF TRAFFIC
            (TCP : sequence count so can track
            a flow of packets)

Layer 7        Application layer firewall : DEEP PACKET INSPECTION
        where INSPECT CONTENTS OF PACKETS for malware!
        (even inside ZIP files)

            can be slow!!! as quite intrusive!!!

```

Ways of splitting up your network

```
1. Router     by IP

2. VLAN        by MAC address on a SWITCH

3. Firewall     block IP traffic

```

NAT and PAT

```
Network Address Translation

Port Address Translation

On our LAN we have a PRIVATE IP EG 192.168.12.10

This is BANNED FROM THE INTERNET!!!

At our ROUTER we turn on NAT Network Address Translation

    we 1) STRIP OUT PRIVATE IP 
       2) REPLACE WITH PUBLIC IP   (FIND OUT WITH 'WHATISMYIP')

IP PACKET BEFORE

        source ip    destination ip        data
        192.168.12.10    157.240.20.35        ....
    
IP PACKET AFTER

        source ip    destination ip     port    data
        80.187.110.1    157.240.20.35    54348    ...

NAT : officially just copes 1 private to 1 public IP

PAT : can cope with 10,000 private computers for 1 public IP

    BUT!!! normally NAT and PAT mean same thing ie 
        many computers ==> all swap IP at router

```

Proxy Server

```
To monitor internet usage we can install a proxy on our network

Proxy allows us to

1) Know which users are using the internet
2) Know which sites
3) Check BLACKLISTED SITES
4) Check Virus in Downloads
5) Cache (store) content for other users  (busy sites, next user
    get content from cache so quicker)

URL FILTER : CHECK URL FOR BLACKLISTED SITES

```

UTM Unified Threat Management

```
Umbrella term : ALL SECURITY DEVICES!!!

```

Web Security Gateway

```
Content Filtering : checking web pages for MALICIOUS CONTENT

```

How to detect an attack!!!

```
How does ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE WORK???

    It takes HASHES OF KNOWN VIRUSES AND DOWNLOADS THE 
    HASHES TO YOUR COMPUTER.  

    SCAN YOUR COMPUTER ==> ANY FILES WHICH MATCH THE 
        VIRUS HASHES ARE FLAGGED

SIGNATURE BASED SCANNING 

    CHECK AGAINST HASHES (SIGNATURE) OF KNOWN VIRUSES

ANOMALY BASED SCANNING

    Take a BASELINE OF PREDICTED BEHAVIOUR

        Watch for deviations from predicted behaviour

        ((Heuristic = Real time scanning))

BEHAVIOUR BASED

    MATCH TRAFFIC AGAINST FIXED RULES OR PATTERNS

        (CAN BE PRONE TO 'FALSE POSITIVE')

New (Zero Day) Viruses

Chapter 4

Overview so far

Wireshark = packet sniffing = Network Protocol Analyser
IDS = Intrusion Detection : Passive (alert only)
IPS = Intrusion Prevention : Active : can take action = eg move machine
to another subnet
HIPS = host based = ONE MACHINE
NIPS = network based = ROUTER/GATEWAY/FIREWALL : PROTECT WHOLE NETWORK

Types of floods we can defend against
TCP : SYN FLOOD : abusing '3-way handshake' to force
server to reserve space for non-existent
connections
PING FLOOD
SMURF ATTACK : MALFORMED PINGS

```
FLOODS IN GENERAL

    DOS ATTACK DENIAL OF SERVICE
    DDOS DISTRIBUTED DOS ATTACK : FROM MANY COMPUTERS
    BOTNET : NETWORK OF INFECTED COMPUTERS WORKING
        TOGETHER TO ATTACK YOU
    ZOMBIE COMPUTER : HAS BEEN INFECTED BUT YOU MAY NOT NOTICE
        (INFECTION MIGHT BE DORMANT)
    LOGIC BOMB : TRIGGER TO WAKE UP ZOMBIE COMPUTER TO ATTACK
                    YOU

```

Ways to dectect viruses or attacks

```
SIGNATURE BASED

    EVERY VIRUS HAS A 'HASH' 
    SYMANTEC ANTIVIRUS COLLECT ALL 'HASHES' FROM KNOWN
        VIRUSES.  DOWNLOAD TO YOUR PC 
        VIRUS SCAN : CHECK COMPUTER : MATCH ANY HASHES

ANOMALY : CREATE GRAPH 'BASELINE' : CHECK FOR DEVIATIONS

BEHAVIOUR : CREATE 'RULES'  : ALERT IF RULES ARE BROKEN/TRIGGERED

Chapter 6 : Malware

Malware - any malicious software of any description (catch-all term)

Virus - needs a 'host' program in order to function. eg Word 'macro'
virus only runs if Word runs

Worm - can 'self-exist' and 'self-replicate'

Trojan - innocent-looking file with malware inside eg music file

Polymorphic Virus - change itself so that the 'hash' changes

Armored Virus - avoid detection by giving false info eg incorrect
readings about its location inside RAM

Zombie = virus doing nothing right now

Logic Bomb = trigger to make a Zombie start working

Botnet = group of infected computers

```
Bot => ONE ROBOT!

```

DOS attack = flood your server to stop it working

```
DOS = denial of service

DDOS = distributed - attack from many computers

```

Backdoor ==> created by programmer to quickly log in and bypass security

```
    ** not done any more!!! ***

```

Rootkit ==> affect PC eg ON HARD DRIVE, MOTHERBOARD, BIOS (BOOT SETTINGS)
==> BEFORE EVEN INSTALL WINDOWS!!!!

```
    very hard for WINDOWS TO EVEN DETECT IT!!!

    ((Offline scan : shut Windows down and scan from DVD))

```

PING FLOOD : lots of PINGS

```
Smurf attack  = malformed PING (fake the sender IP)

```

TCP SYN FLOOD

```
Send lots of 'TCP hello' requests

```

PORT SCAN

```
Scan your network for open ports

    MXTOOLBOX 

```

XMAS ATTACK

```
Scan network : flags set to '1' or 'high' to provoke a response
    to get extra info back

BANNER GRABBING : SEND MESSAGE TO WEBSITE OR SERVER : HOPE TO 
    GET RESPONSE WHICH GIVES US BASIC INFO LIKE SERVER
    TYPE OR OPERATING SYSTEM

```

MITM Man in the middle attack

```
Client--------- bad router -----------    Server

        bad router listens or
        'eavesdrops' on messages.
        Also can alter packets

```

Session Hijack

```
client         bad router -------------server

        Server thinks it's talking to client
        but it's not.  bad router has 'hijacked'
        the session

```

Session Replay Attack

```
Bad router will copy all packets.  Later on, resend.

    EASY TO STOP : USE TIMESTAMPS!!!

```

Birthday attack

```
DISCOVER THAT TWO FILES HAVE SAME HASH AND CAN EXPLOIT THIS
    TO GET PASS HASHING SOFTWARE

```

DNS attack

```
DNS POISON
    
    fake DNS records eg SERVERA  IP = 1.2.3.4

        people looking for SERVERA get sent to wrong IP

PHARMING ATTACK

    Sending client to WRONG SITE : OFTEN HACK INTO LOCAL 
    COMPUTER (HOSTS FILE : CAN CHANGE THIS)

    c:windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc

```

Chapter 7 continued

Typo Squatting

```
Buying domains with A) MIS-SPELLING or B) ADDING EXTRA WORDS
    to well known domains

gooogle.com

```

URL Hijacking

```
Buying domain names that don't belong to you --> make money
    from selling to legitimate owner

```

Watering hole attack

```
Social media and other popular websites ==> place where
    'opportunist' hackers can hang out, looking for
    people/systems to attack

```

Flash Cookie and 'LSO' locally shared objects

```
==> old!!!  Cookies on Flash Websites!!!

```

Application Attacks

```
EXPLOIT VULNERABILITIES IN APPS/WEBSITES THAT YOU USE

Injection Attack

    Form........Name?   Address?? Zip Code???  Phone??

    ATTACKER PUTS PROGRAMMING CODE INSTEAD OF ANSWERS TO 
            QUESTION!!!

    
Input Validation

    CHECK ALL INPUT FOR ODD CHARACTERS LIKE

        ' \\  <  >  *  ETC

    check numbers/dates not too high/low

    block <script>  code (HTML)

    CLIENT = YOUR PHONE OR PC  ** EASILY HACKED **

    SERVER = DATA SENT TO SERVER

        MUST VALIDATE DATA AT BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER!

Race condition : two programs accessing SAME DATA AT SAME TIME

Error
    Bank loan ==> CALCULATE WRONG RATE!!!

Exception

    CRASH!!!  SYSTEM RUNNING : HITS BUG , STOP WORKING!!

        ==> GIVE DETAILED ERROR  ((HACKER CAN USE THIS
            TO GET INFO))

Buffer Overflow Attack

                    RAM
    Hard drive  ========>   ||||||||||||||||||  BUFFER  <====>|
                reserved RAM               OVERFLOW
    Network card

    Router

    Switch

        Buffer overflow ==> ATTEMPTING TO DELIBERATELY
            FORCE DATA INTO BUFFER.  GOAL : OVERFLOW
            LEGAL BOUNDARIES TO ACCESS OTHER AREAS
            OF RAM

Injection Attack

    SQL : database
    LDAP : Active Directory
    XML : 

Cross-site scripting

    Public website hosting : danger is attacker hack into
    one website ==> gain access to another.

XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery

    Logged in to website so potential for hacking is greater

Credentialed attack : logged in
Non-credentialled attack : not logged it

Directory Traversal ==> 

    c:\\MYSITE\\...

    hacker.. use this to gain access also to

    c:\\myothersite\\....  (different folder)

Fuzz Testing

    Test application ==> DOES IT STAND UP TO USER ABUSE???

        Try to send RANDOM DATA INTO APP TO SEE IF 
            IT CRASHES!!!  FUZZ TESTING !!!

```

Certificates

```
Certificates help us VALIDATE TRANSACTIONS

PUBLIC : ANYONE CAN HAVE

PRIVATE : KEEP SECURE

```

Installing a Certificate Server (CA = Certificate Authority)

```
SERVER ROLE !!!

ROOT CA

    INTERMEDIATE CA

        ISSUING CA ==> GIVE OUT CERTIFICATES TO USERS

Template : used to give DETAILS OF A CERTIFICATE WHEN IT'S 
        REQUESTED BY A USER

    - encryption type
    - how long is it valid (eg 5 years)
    - use eg Email Signing, Smartcard, Encryption ...

Enrol ==> Ask for a certificate eg user needs for encryption

    Auto-enrol : server handle
    Manual enrol : human must approve

    Already a user : want another certificate

        CSR CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST

            Sign a request with your private key,
            Send to server,
            Returned a FRESH CERTIFICATE

Revoke = Annul a certificate

    2 lists of revoked certificates

    1) OFFLINE  :    CRL  Certificate Revocation List (all
                    bad certificates)

        EXAM : PROBLEM : CAN GET BIG, SLOW TO USE!

        << delta CRL = most recent updates>>

    2) ONLINE  : OCSP online certificate status protocol

        QUICK : only check for 1 certificate

    ESCROW : STORE CERTIFICATES WITH 3RD PARTY COMPANY

        !!! CAREFUL !!!

        M OF N 

            UNLOCK CERTIFICATE : REQUIRE M PEOPLE
            FROM GROUP OF N PRESENT

            EG 2 OF 5

```

Risk (325)

```
Impact ==> how much we are affected by something bad happening
        
SLE SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY == HOW MUCH 1 INCIDENT COSTS  

ARO ANNUAL RATE OCCURENCE == TIMES PER YEAR

ALE ANNUAL LOSS EXPECTANCY = SLE X ARO

    SLE = $10,000
    ARO = 10 / YEAR
    ALE = $100,000  / YEAR

Quantitative

    numerical analysis  30% chance

Qualitative

    Guestimate  :  medium risk ?????

MTBF    Mean Time Between Failure  ~~~~  MTTF

        Light Bulb MTBF = 100,000 YEARS

MTTR Mean Time to Repair / Recover / Restore

    SERVER GOES DOWN WITH HARD DRIVE

        1) NEW HARD DRIVE
        2) BACKUP RESTORE
        3) CONFIGURE ==========> 4 DAYS!!!

```

Steps the attacker uses

```
Footprinting        public knowledge - legal means to find
            out info about you

Fingerprinting         illegal methods to gain info about you
            eg ip scan, port scan, other attacks

Banner Grabbing        Send packets to server : analyse 
            HEADERS COMING BACK TO YOU (INITIAL 
            RESPONSE)

```

What we can do

```
Vulnerability Assessment

    ANALYSING YOUR COMPANY FOR FLAWS

    Vulnerability Scan ==> NICHE SCAN : ONE TYPE OF FLAW
        EG OPEN PORTS

        NON-INTRUSIVE !

Pen Test ==> Penetration Test : ACTUALLY TRY AND HACK IN!!!

    INTRUSIVE !!!

Code review : reading programming code : spot flaws

Audits : check for 

    COMPLIANCE TO POLICY
    LOGS : EVIDENCE OF BREAK IN ETC

Redundancy = cope with disaster

```
SPOF Single point of failure

RAID 5 : 3 DRIVES MIN        CAN  ONLY LOSE 1 DRIVE

RAID 6 : 4 DRIVES MIN        CAN LOSE 2 DRIVES!!!

```

Server Redundancy

```
99.999 % uptime     "FIVE 9'S"

HOW MANY MINUTES DOWN A YEAR???

0.00001  X   MINUTES IN A YEAR

```

Power

```
UPS : BATTERY : 30 MINUTES

GENERATOR : HOSPITAL : MANY HOURS

```

Backups

```
Archive Bit = 1 or 0

    1 = NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP
    0 = DOESN'T NEED TO BE BACKED UP

Full = Normal = Back up everything

Incremental : Fresh backup every day of JUST WORK THAT HAS 
            CHANGED THAT DAY

                    ((reset archive 'bit'))

Differential : Fresh backup every day of ALL FILES CHANGED
            SINCE LAST FULL BACKUP (doesn't touch 
                        archive bit))

                CUMULATIVE DAILY BACKUP

Diffential Example

    Friday : Full Backup 50GB
    Monday : Differential 500MB
    Tues   : Mon(500MB) + Tues(300MB)
    Wed    : Mon(500) + Tue(300) + Wed(250)

        SYSTEM CRASH THURSDAY MORNING
