## 202412 tech latest

amazon nova ai

appium is website and mobile testing

microsoft recall takes a screenshot every 5 seconds if the content changes then does image analysis to extract the text and understand what is on the screen






## 202412 stuff to build

hasura cloud enables a robust api to be built from your data

make.com is like zapier or ifttt event handling

ifttt

zapier is like ifttt

## 202412 ai 

feed this into chat gpt and see what happens 

write me a python script which launches a server locally for an html file which has a big text box.  when i enter text into that box and press submit, it should send that request for code to the openai o3-mini api with seed medium reasoning_effort, take the resulting code, save it to a temporary file on the desktop, then execute that file in a new python terminal.  A few more details - it can find my api key in ~/api_key.  please add some extra prompting into the request to the api to specify that it should only return raw code without any formatting or markdown at all.  you will be executing on a mac laptop.


google deepmind has built genie 2 which can create playable games on the fly

supervised learning has a labelled data set

reinforcement learning is like rewarding a dog for good behaviour

feed forward neural network only moves in one direction

recurrent neural network has loops

convulutional neural network handles images to find edges or shapes

regular neural network is basic block

full connected layer - all neurons connected to next layer

pooling layer summarises data

L1 vs L2 regularisation - prevents overfitting - L1 use few features L2 uses all features with smaller weights

gradient descent optimises parameters

batch gradient descent uses whole data set

stochastic gradient descent is faster but can be less stable as only using few parameters

loss function is a measure of the ai failure rate

overfitting gets focused on existing data instead of being ready for new data

adapter stiches existing technology to new ai framework

automation gets tedious work done eg clickup automations 

generative ai creates content eg images and videos ie it generates stuff rather than just analyses stuff

hallucination is incorrect results

IPL information processing language is a foundational AI language from 1950s

LLM large language model uses human language

NLG natural language generation generates human readable output

SOM self organising maps/models - AI analyes its own data to simplify it and create mappings from within its own data, to understand the data structures within

AGI artificial general intelligence is an all-round AI 

Frontier AI is on the current cusp and leading edge of AI technology

disambiguation is removing of possible double meanings or confusion in the actual meaning of a word or phrase

domain is an area of expertise or knowledge

ontology is similar to taxonomy classification of species but does so with nodes and also adds descriptions

guardrails ensure ai does not produce inappropriate content

neural network mimics the function of the brain to drive inputs and outputs

interpretability is the ability to explain how results were derived ... same as accountability or explainability

digital twin mimics a real world object eg a bridge

HITL human in the loop allows input from human

multi agent system can have agents directly talk to each other

multimodal ai can work across different media eg text, images, video

zero shot learning allows the ai to learn completely from scratch, a dangerous proposition

anthromorphism allocates human qualities to ai

context window is the allocatable amount of memory used for input and output to and from an ai system eg the size of the text chat box for ai chat gpt

reinforcement learning uses cycles to get better

token is smallest unit of text that an ai engine can understand

.mjs stands for module javascript and stands for ES javascript using import export syntax

destructuring with alias allows one to destructure an object but then also rename the fields in one go 

currying functions allows you to create multiple versions of a single function

debouncing prevents a function from being called after it was previously called, until a certain time has elapsed.  useful => input form field

```js
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

const search = debounce((query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for ${query}`);
  // Imagine an API call here
}, 300);

document.getElementById('searchInput').addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  search(event.target.value);
});
```

throttling specifies a function is used only once in a given time period, for example scroll event handling

```js
function throttle(func, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function(...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scrolled');
  // Imagine complex calculations or DOM updates here
}, 300);

window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

memoization caches the results of expensive function calls ... and return same results when same inputs are applied

```js
const memoize = (fn) => {
  const cache = {};
  return (...args) => {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (!cache[key]) {
      cache[key] = fn(...args);
    }
    return cache[key];
  };
};

const fibonacci = memoize((n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
});

console.log(fibonacci(40)); // 102334155
```

console.table for js objects

console.time() starts a stopwatch 

console.timeEnd() ends a stopwatch

structured clone creates a full deep clone copy of an object, at all levels

```js
const obj = { 
  a: 1, 
  b: { c: 2 },
  date: new Date(),
  arr: [1, 2, 3],
  nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }]
};
const clonedObj = structuredClone(obj);

console.log(clonedObj); 
// { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, date: 2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z, arr: [1, 2, 3], nestedArr: [{ d: 4 }] }
console.log(clonedObj === obj); // false
console.log(clonedObj.b === obj.b); // false
console.log(clonedObj.date === obj.date); // false
console.log(clonedObj.arr === obj.arr); // false
console.log(clonedObj.nestedArr[0] === obj.nestedArr[0]); // false
```

IIFE functions are executed immediately and avoid polluting global scope, helps maintain clean code by avoiding global scope

## sanitising input strings

we can sanitise input strings to stop injection attacks

```js
function sanitize(strings, ...values) {
  return strings.reduce((result, string, i) => {
    let value = values[i - 1];
    if (typeof value === 'string') {

## 202411 react new features

concurrent rendering manages rendering priorities ... `useTransition`

we can mark some updates as `non-urgent` so more critical renders are run first

react 19 updates

1. Advanced Concurrent Rendering: Making UIs More Responsive

Concurrent rendering was a big step forward in React 18, but React 19 refines it even further. The enhancements in React 19 allow you to manage rendering priorities with more granularity, making your apps feel snappier and more responsive, especially when juggling heavy computations or multiple user interactions.

Code Snippet: Optimizing with useTransition

React’s useTransition hook helps manage state transitions, allowing you to mark updates as non-urgent. This keeps your UI responsive by prioritizing more critical renders first.In this example, startTransition allows React to defer the less urgent state update (search results) until more critical updates are complete, improving user experience during heavy operations.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function SearchComponent() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleSearch = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value);
    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate heavy computation
      const filteredResults = performHeavySearch(event.target.value);
      setResults(filteredResults);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={query} onChange={handleSearch} placeholder="Search..." />
      {isPending ? <p>Loading results...</p> : <ResultList results={results} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`streaming suspense` for real time data fetching

components load data and allow them to begin rendering before all the data has arrived

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load component with data fetching
const UserProfile = React.lazy(() => fetchUserProfileData());

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user profile...</div>}>
      <UserProfile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

async function fetchUserProfileData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user');
  const data = await response.json();
  return () => <ProfileComponent data={data} />;
}
```



`automatic error recovery` to keep apps working smoothly ... uses `onRecoverableError`, `onCaughtTrigger`, `onUncaughtTrigger`



enhanced `developer tools` eg `state inspector`, `component filter improvements`, `performance tab updates`



react `server components` can render parts of the app on the server

```js
// app/server-component.js
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const result = await data.json();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Server-Side Data</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

// pages/index.js
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import ServerComponent from '../app/server-component';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React 19</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading server data...</div>}>
        <ServerComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```


`server actions` means that server-side logic can be run with the `use-server` directive which flags that code should run on the server not the client.

```js
// components/SubmitForm.js
'use server'; // This directive tells React that this function runs on the server

export async function submitForm(data) {
  // Simulate a server-side operation, like saving to a database
  console.log('Processing data on the server:', data);

  // Example of server-side logic
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/save', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to save data on the server.');
  }

  return response.json();
}
```


avoid react `useEffect` ... use server actions and server components

amazon compute is short for amazon compute cloud also known as ec2

acu azure compute unit is a measure of the power of a machine

acu 100 matches the power of a standard_a1 machine

sku stock keeping unit is a barcode on a product

sku in aws is a unique product for sale eg a given machine with a given spec

ec2 region is geographic area, availability zone is logical subnet within that region, inside which we have local zone which is geographically close to the user, inside which we have outpost which is single data center

ec2 region => zone => local zone => outpost ... 

ec2 region geographic => zone logical => local physical => outpost physical

ec2 has regions which are split into availability zones and these are split into local zones and these are split into aws outposts

ec2 region is geographic

ec2 availability zone is logical grouping within a geographical region, perhaps serviced by different electricity suppliers

ec2 availability zone has one per subnet

ec2 availability zone is a collection of data centers inside a region

ec2 local zones allow placing of rescourcees physically close to you for sake of latency

ec2 outposts put aws services in particular data center

### 202410 streaming

dash dynamic adaptive streaming over http - best for high quality and best for on demand streaming. used by shaka, vlc, videojs, libdash

libdash provides open source oop library to mpeg dash streaming for live and vod

scte-35 marker indicates where other content eg adverts can be inserted into a video stream

watermarking helps to protect streaming content 

abr adaptive bitrate streaming assumes that lowering the bitrate is more important than letting the user experience buffering, rendering the most suitable content renditions

rendition is a version of a stream at a given resolution for streaming at a given bitrate

manifest defines files to be fetched as part of adaptive bitrate streaming abr stream

## maths

lower bound

upper bound

significant figures 

congruent means same size and shape

similar means identical in shape but can differ in scale/size eg 2 times bigger, length of sides are in same ratio, area is in ratio, volume is in ratio, etc

pythagoras a squared plus b squared is c squared

sine rule area equals half side a times side b times sin angle C

area of trapezium is half (sum of both parallel sides) times vertical height

volume of a cylinder is pi times radius squared times height of cylinder

surface area of a cylinder is (2 times pi times radius times height ) plus (2 times pi times radius squared)

volume of a pyramid is one third times base area times vertical height

volume of a cone is one third of pi times radius squared times vertical height

surface area of a cone is base area plus cone area which is (pi times radius squared) plus (pi times radius times long edge (not vertical height!))

volume of sphere is 4 thirds pi times radius cubed

surface area of sphere = 4 pi r squared

volume of frustrum is volume of full cone minus volume of top cone

circle area is pi r squared

Cosine Rule: a squared = b squared + c squared - 2bc cosine A

Sine Rule: sin A over A = Sin B over B

Volume of sphere is 4/3 PI R cubed

Volume of cone is 1/3 PI R squared x height

factorisation

quadratic equations in powers of x squared

simultaneous equations

coefficient

translation moving from a to b

reflection in a mirror

rotation about a point or by an angle

enlargement

bearings is angle and distance

rationalise denominator

fibonacci 

sets : x is a member of A 

A n B    intersection

A u B    union

v = u + at

s = ut + 1/2 a t squared

v2 = u2 + 2as

lowest common multiple eg 2, 10 => 10

highest common factor 6,9 => 3

prime factors  

indices

x to power m * x to power n = x to power (m+n)

x to power m / x to power n = x to power (m-n)

(x to power m) to power n = x to power (m*n)

1/(x to power n) = x to power (-n)

x to power 1/2 = square root of x

x to power (1/n) = nth root of x

x to power (m/n) = nth root of x to the power m

surds have irrational roots

irrational cannot be broken down into whole number

root of (ab) = (root of a) * (root of b)

root of (a/b) = (root of a) / (root of b)

floating point number is mantissa * radix to the power exponent

### big data

- Apache Hadoop allows for distributed processing 
- Apache Spark runs data engineering on clusters
- Apache Hive stores big data to SQL
- Apache Kafka is used for big data stream processing



### azure

- application insights - app stats and issues
- DocumentDB is NoSQL
- ExpressRoute
- HDInsight is big data analytics
- StorSimple - cloud NAS/SAN
- Traffic Manager - DNS and load balancing
- Fabric Controller manages VM clusters
- identity
  - can sync with local AD
  - ADFS Federated Services can provide identity services eg 2FA across platforms

# AWS

#### IAM Security

- Principal is the person we are giving permissions to 
- Action is what is being applied
- Resource is which properties are being accessed

Least Privilege - minimal permissions

##### IAM Policy

    - Identity Policy applies to a principal
    - Resource Policy applies to a resource

#### Network Security

Defense in depth : multi-layered approach

##### VPC Virtual Private Cloud

This is a logical network to which permissions can be applied

It consists of 

- Subnet (ranges of IP)
- Route tables to direct traffic
- Gateway to communicate with outside world


### AWS secure web app demo 

in Intro to AWS Cloud Security Course at Secure Communication part

```
Goal : communicate web app to database in AWS
decrypt data with key
view app logs CloudTrail
view aws logs CloudWatch
```



## AWS Abstracted Services

```
customer receives endpoint url

S3 storage
DynamoDB (NoSQL)
SQS Simple Queuing Service which can trigger a lambda function
Glacier stores cold archive data
```

## AWS Environment Security

### IAM

```
Can provide access to users
Can authorize access to resources
Can authorize federated users eg Facebook or Google users in IAM=>IdentityProviders

IAM Policy to allow open access
{
"Sid":
"Effect":....
"Action":"dynamodb":*",
"Resource":"*"
}

IAM for one table
{
"Sid":
"Effect":"Allow",
"Action [
 "dynamodb:Get*",
 "dynamodb:Query"
],
"Resource":"arn:aws:dynamodb":*:*:table/MyTable"
}

```

### AWS Cloudwatch Application Logs

```
Important to have application logs for troubleshooting
Can query logs
Alarms
  Alert admins with SNS Simple Notification Service
  Autoscaling when CPU exceeds EC2 threshold (also called elastic scaling)
Demo
    Cloudwatch > Logs > /name-of-service/name-of-event/hash-of-log
    Logs => can create an alarm also => metrics => lambda => select function => choose to
    alarm on errors
  

```

### Amazon Inspector : Vulnerability Scanning

# AWS Container Security

AWS manage OS and service

AWS and customer share

IAM

firewall

Customer secures data

## AWS VPC Virtual Private Cloud

Lab in ‘Intro to AWS Cloud Security’ Pluralsight

Create a subnet

public

private

Gateway to internet or private network

NAT allow private instances access to public internet

Virtual private cloud consists of a least 2 subnets : one private and one public

Private subnet

- Database
- Background Services

Public subnet

- NAT Gateway
- Web instances

both subnets connect to a router which connects to the internet

should restrict unauthorised access

### AWS KMS key service

- Customer Master Key can be managed by customer or AWS
- KMS protected in HSM hardware module

### AWS Example : Bank

Access via API which calls database. Data is encrypted on database but decrypted with KMS key and sent to customer

### RDS relational database

### Elastic beanstalk - app deployment

### AWS Environment Variables

In JSON files AWS keys can be kept in %USERPROFILE%.aws\\credentials file for example

[default]
aws_access_key_id=<your access key id>
aws_secret_access_key=<your secret access key>

## Serverless Computing

Serverless = function-as-a-service

# Load Balancing

NGINX
API Gateway
nginx.com
AWS Route53
Auto scaling
NGINX controller
Caching content
Content distribution networks
AWS Pattern
AWS Quick Start guide to NGINX
Load balancers solve the problem of 
   Performance
   Scale up : Vertical : More CPU/RAM/Hard Drive
   Scale out : horizontal : add more computers
   Availability
   Economy
Server-side load balancers
Network load balancers : OSI layer 3 : good for balancing raw network load
Application load balancers : OSI layer 7 : more advanced as content of packets known
IAAS Infrastructure As A Service - render VM via API

## Types Of Load Balancer

### Cloud

Elastic Load Balancer (AWS)

ALB Application Load Balancer

NLB Network Load Balancer

### Ported from real machines

### Software Load Balancer
Installed on top of OS

### Global Route Balancing With Route 53
Enables you to direct your users to the closest endpoint geographically around the globe
Geolocation routing allows specifying endpoints by region geographically

### Latency-based routing
Detects closest region based on lowest DNS latency which beats geographic distance

## Considerations Of Load Balancing

### Scaling Infrastructure

Must be able to register and de-register nodes from load balancing pools through automation

### Scaling Load Balancers

Must be able to scale load balancers

EC2 => instance => connect => use given code to connect
```

### AWS RDS database access

```
Create mysql database
add security group with inbound and outbound rules
can configure inbound rules to only allow set ip addresses
```

### AWS Securing Access To S3

```
view files
create public files
restrict access to bucket
 - public
 - access control list
 - bucket policies

Lab
Create bucket
Add image
Make image public
Click on URL to view image in browser

Access by 
- public ?
- access control lists
- advanced bucket policy for others to access eg restrict access per user in a shared s3
   bucket

```

### Installing Linux with a GUI

```
# install basic terminal tools
sudo apt install tmux git ranger vim
# 2GB download takes a while
sudo apt install lubuntu-desktop -y
# List Block Storage Volumes ie Drives

## Vagrant

### Vagrant : get started guide

[https://learn.hashicorp.com/vagrant/#getting-started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vagrant/#getting-started)

Vagrant can use scripts from `Packer`, `Chef` or `Ansible` to provsion and create and run virtual machines

### Vagrant with Hyper-V

```
# enable with 
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
# create and run first default vm  (this failed on Windows!)
vagrant box add hashicorp/bionic64
# show machines
vagrant box list
vagrant up 
```

### Vagrant With Virtualbox

[https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/dev-environments](https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/dev-environments)

```
choco install virtualbox -y
choco install vagrant -y
restart-computer
```


Virtual box drivers are not installed !
Manually install : right click on .inf and install

### CMD (not powershell) terminal as admin :
sc start vboxdrv

Control panel => Network Adapters => VBox Host Only Network 
 => Properties => Install => Service => Add => Oracle 
 => choose the only service there => OK

Remove HyperV

### Vagrant Initial Steps

Vagrant files are written in Ruby!

```bash
# Create Vagrantfile
vagrant init

# Set a more specific version
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

### This is the copy of the Vagrant file which works now
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
end

# In windows, make sure HyperV is not conflicting with VirtualBox - turn it off and reboot
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off          (on or auto to restore it)

# turn on (5-10 minutes)
vagrant up

# log in
vagrant ssh

# update
sudo apt-get update -y

# install nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

# start nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

# check if running
ps aux | grep nginx
service nginx status

# start also with this command
sudo service nginx start/stop
    

# see which service is using port 80
netstat -tulpn | grep :80

# if it works you can now do, in a browser
http://localhost:80  
# and a web page will appear

# reload machine with new configuration
vagrant reload

# or

# take down vm then boot up again

```bash
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```

# set dns

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```

# add to config fileconfig.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

# this is the script which works


```bash
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]
end
```

# Now access via 

http://192.168.10.100

http://development.local


## Provisioning

[https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/provisioning](https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/mutable-pipelines/provisioning)

Provision = configure and setup an environment

- Folders
- Files
- Programs
- Scripts

### Provision A Folder

```bash
# maps /app to /app on VM

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

  # Synced app folder
  config.vm.synced_folder "app", "/app"
  config.vm.synced_folder "c:/app", ls"/app"  # windows

end
```

### which

```bash
# find out the path to an executable
which ruby
```

### update and upgrade

```bash
# update metadata
sudo apt update
# upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### nginx

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

### Provisioning an environment

```bash
mkdir environment
cd environment
touch provision.sh

# add this to provision.sh

#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install nginx -y

sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
sudo npm install pm2 -g


# Now add this provisioning to our Vagrant script

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
  config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

  # Synced app folder
  config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/Shared/Vagrant/starter-code/app", "/home/ubuntu/app"

  # Provisioning
  config.vm.provision "shell", path: "environment/provision.sh"

end

# Try running the app with (on Windows)

vagrant destroy -f; vagrant up; vagrant ssh 

# also play around with adding data to files remotely
# add to new file
echo hello > testfile.txt
echo ' ' >> .bashrc 
echo hello >> .bashrc
echo ' ' >> .bashrc
echo 'export VAR_01=variable01' >> .bashrc
echo 'export VAR_02=variable02' >> .bashrc
# also
echo 'test' >> /home/vagrant/.bashrc

# This is the sample
require 'spec_helper'

describe package('nginx') do
  it { should be_installed }
end

describe service("nginx") do
  it { should be_running }
  it { should be_enabled }
end

describe port(80) do
  it { should be_listening }
end

describe package('nodejs') do
  it { should be_installed }

# Docker

Docker is the world’s leading software container platform.

Docker is a container technology in which containers are packed up with necessary libraries and dependencies in a standardized unit for software development

[https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/orchestration-and-containerization/docker-intro](https://github.com/spartaglobal/new-curriculum/tree/master/devops/orchestration-and-containerization/docker-intro)

### Install Docker

[https://hub.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition](https://hub.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition)

### Hello World

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world

# download and run ubuntu and load up a bash command line inside the ubuntu
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# list images
docker image ls
# list containers
docker container ls --all

# run ubuntu with more advanced command
docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu bash

# install ping
apt-get install -y iputils-ping

# hostname
hostname
```

### DockerFiles

```bash
FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Building a docker file

```bash
docker build .

# tag with a name

docker build . -t simple-app

# run the command from the parent folder
docker build simple-app --tag simple-app

# view images
docker images

# run an image
docker run simple-app

# running images
docker ps

FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install nginx -y

# run nginx in foregreound mode
CMD nginx -g 'daemon off;'

## rebuild and run
docker build . -t simple-app
docker run simple-app
```

### Docker with ports

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 simple-app
```

### Run docker in the background

```bash
# start docker as a background service
docker run -p 80:80 -d simple-app
# stop it
docker stop <<id>>
docker rm <<id>>

# remove image
docker rmi <<id>>
```

### NginX

```bash
# download and run docker instance running nginx
docker run --detach --publish 80:80 --name webserver nginx 

# view the instance in your browser by going to http://localhost 

# stop the container 
docker container stop webserver
# start it
docker container start webserver
# remove it
docker container rm <<name1>> <<name2>>
```

### Node Sample App

```bash
# download it
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/node-bulletin-board
cd node-bulletin-board/bulletin-board-app
# build it
cd .. (so we are in node-bulletin-board folder)
docker build bulletin-board-app --tag bulletinboard:1.0
# run it
docker run --publish 8000:8080 --detach --name bb bulletinboard:1.0
# view app at http://localhost:8000
# remove running container
docker rm bb --force
```

### Pushing Docker Container to Docker Hub

```bash
Docker Hub => Repositories => Create
philanderson888/test-node-app

# on the Docker CLI
docker tag bulletinboard:1.0 philanderson888/test-node-app
docker push philanderson888/test-node-app
```

## docker and node

    },
    “dependencies”: {
        “express”: “^4.13.3”
    }
}
```

### server.js

```js
'use strict';
const express = require('express');
// Constants
const PORT = 8080;
// App
const app = express();
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('Hello world\\\\n');
});
app.listen(PORT);
console.log('Running on <http://localhost>:' + PORT);

# Create a Dockerfile
touch Dockerfile
    
### Build image from LTS 'argon' version of node
FROM node:argon

### build working directory
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

### install dependencies    
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
RUN npm install
            
### copy source code into docker image
COPY . /usr/src/app
```

### Docker Environment Variables

The standard for protecting sensitive credentials in production environments is to use Environment Variables Docker, via docker-compose and docker-compose.yml, easily allows developers to introduce environment variables and values, but you don’t want to commit those to a repo, so the answer is creating a docker-compose.override.yml file on your local machine which contains the sensitive information: The information in docker-compose.override.yml is added to (or overrides) the directives in docker-compose.yml. Since git and mercurial will allow you to commit docker-compose.override.yml files, the other important step is adding your docker-compose.override.yml file to your .gitignore or .hgignore file, preventing the file from being seen from the two version control tools. docker-compose.override.yml

### Docker Compose - YAML multi-docker environments

Docker Compose provides configuration and running of multi-docker environments using YAML

```

[https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/)

### Container sample: Run a simple application

```
You can quickly run a container with a pre-built .NET Core Docker image, based on the .NET Core console sample.

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples

```

### Container sample: Run a web application

```
You can quickly run a container with a pre-built .NET Core Docker image, based on the ASP.NET Core sample.

Type the following command to run a sample web application:

docker run -it --rm -p 8000:80 --name aspnetcore_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples:aspnetapp

```

### Building a sample .NET Core application on Docker

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images

Clone the sample app

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/>
```

Move to the root directory of this repository then type

```bash
cd samples

cd aspnetapp

docker build --pull -t aspnetapp .

docker run --name aspnetcore_sample --rm -it -p 8000:80 aspnetapp
```

### Worked Example With Commands

```bash
# list running containers
docker container ls

# remove container
docker container kill ce2df9017968

# list images
docker image ls

# list images with id
docker images -a

# remove image
docker rmi 99f959836f85

# run docker image
docker run --name aspnetcore_sample --rm -it -p 8000:80 aspnetapp

# Type <http://localhost:8000> and view a running ASP app

```

## Creating And Running Docker From Visual Studio

### Run a .NET ASP Core Web App On Docker

Make sure Docker Desktop is running

Choose Linux (Not Windows)

Build and run the project

### Push New Docker Image To Docker Hub

```bash
docker ps (running)

docker ps -a  (all images)

docker login —username=philanderson888

docker images

REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
dockersupport                          dev                 b23fdedefa86        57 minutes ago      207MB

// tag the image
docker tag b23fdedefa86    philanderson888/dockersupport:version01
docker push philanderson888/dockersupport

// docker image will now be available at <https://hub.docker.com/> 

    

```

### Run Docker Image From Azure

```bash
### Log in
portal.azure.com
### Connect to Azure Cloud Shell

### create a resource group
az group create --name docker-container-test --location uksouth

## create DNS name to expose to the internet
DNS_NAME_LABEL=aci-demo-$RANDOM

### Create instance

az container create \\
  --resource-group docker-container-test \\
  --name docker-container \\
  --image philanderson888/dockersupport \\
  --ports 80 \\
  --dns-name-label philanderson888-docker-asp-net-core-web-app \\
  --location uksouth

# Kubernetes

Orchestrates multiple containers

## Kubernetes Terminology

## Orchestration

- so we don’t have to deploy containers individually
- picture of real coordination in a real orchestra

    Orchestrator : dynamic management

    ```
        Examples : Kubernetes, DC/OS, Nomad, Swarm
    ```

```
Master - controls replication, scheduling, external load balancers, public ip
Node - like a VM running container images
Pod - service consisting of one or more container images
   

Master - coordinates the cluster - schedules, maintains state, scales, rolls out updates
Node - VM or physical computer which serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster
Kubelet - agent software on each Node - manages the node and communicates with the master
Kubernetes API - Exposed by the master and used by the nodes and end users
Cluster
Minikube - lightweight version of Kubernetes
   cluster   -   start, stop, status, delete
```

kubectl describe pods # shows older image running
```

### Kubernetes Deployments

We can `deploy` our apps into our `cluster`

To do this we create a `deployment configuration`

`Deployment configuration` instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of the application.

`Kubernetes Deployment Controller` monitors running instances. If a node fails, another instance is spun up on another node. This is called `self-healing`. Before orchestration we would manually use scripts to start the applications but there was no self-healing.

A `Kubernetes Cluster` consists of the master node with the deployment instructions, and other nodes which run the containerised app.

## Kubernetes Deployment Tutorial

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics>
                              /deploy-app/deploy-interactive/

# show all nodes 

kubectl get nodes
 
kubectl version

1. Find node (only 1 here) to deploy on
2. Run the app
3. Configure to re-run if the node collapses

```bash
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
```

4 look at deployments - shows the running app

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

5. expose our app to a proxy web address

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

6. view data

```bash
curl <http://localhost:8001/version>  or /  or /api  or /apis
```

7. run in a new terminal window 

```bash
print "\\n\\n\\n"
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

echo (kubectl get pods -o go-template --template 
               '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}')

set-item -Path Env:POD_NAME -value (kubectl get pods -o go-template 
            --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}')
```

## Kubernetes Pods And Nodes

A `node` is a worker machine in a cluster. It can contain one or more `pods`

A `pod` can contain one or more containers for example one container for the storage and another one for the application.

- shared storage
- IP
- Ports
- Container image version

A `pod` represents a logical application host. It can contain different `application containers` eg an app and the data

Pod containers are

- co-located
- share IP
- share port
- co-scheduled

Pod is the atomic unit on the `Kubernetes` platform

In case of failure, pods can be put onto other nodes.

Pods run on `nodes` which may be a physical or virtual machine depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the `master` One node can have multiple `pods` and the master handles this.

Every node runs

- Kubelet = process to run communication between Node and master
- Container runtime which
    - gets the image
    - unpacks the image
    - runs the application

## Extra Kubernetes Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods

kubectl logs

kubectl exec
```

## Kubernetes Services

![https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg)

https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cc38b0f3c0fd94e66495e3a4198f2096cdecd3d5/ace10/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/public/images/module_04_services.svg

A cluster node holds several pods. A cluster has an IP

Each pod can have an IP internally which is not exposed unless deliberately by the `service`

A `service` defines a logical set of pods and their coupling via a YAML or JSON file.

The set of pods are targeted using a `LabelSelector`

`Services` can be exposed in different ways

- ClusterIP Reachable only internally (default)
- NodePort IP:Port reachable externally
- LoadBalancer (fixed external IP routes queries in)
- ExternalName kube-dns

`Services` can group across `pods` and even across `nodes` and can expose a service IP address which is different to each pod IP.

Each item in a service can be `tagged` with that service name

## Kubernetes Service Tutorial

[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-interactive/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-interactive/)

```bash
# Learn how to expose an app outside the cluster with `kubectl expose` command
# Apply labels/tags to objects with `kubectl label` command
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080
kubectl get services
kubectl describe services
# export kube the Node port number as a variable and then connect to it with curl
# service is exposed on internet but not on local powershell demo!
curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT 

## use labels (works on web demo)
kubectl get pods -l run=hello-minikube 
## same on powershell
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl get pods -n default
kubectl describe pods

# Running the same tutorial via powershell on local machine
minikube version
minikube start
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

# returns for example 32104 which is the port exposed by the service
echo (kubectl get services/hello-minikube -o go-template --template '{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
curl $(minikube ip):echo (kubectl get services/hello-minikube -o go-template --template '{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')

# but curl to the ip:32104 is not working
```

### Blockchain

Blockchain has many features which are desirable such as

- Immutability
- Automation
- Decentralisation

App developers can now use Blockchain to create a permanent record of the progress of work in development of an app. Every aspect of the development of the app can be tracked and verified.

Blockchain can also provide levels of encryption which cannot be hacked without the permission of the developer.

Blockchain has a low cost of entry and a relatively high return on investment.

# HyperV

```

### NAT

```powershell
### Your second option is NAT
### turn on NAT on the nested Hyper-V VM 
new-vmswitch -name VmNAT -SwitchType Internal
New-NetNat –Name LocalNAT –InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix “192.168.100.0/24”
### assign an IP address to the new internal adapter
### This will be the gateway address for VMs in Hyper-V
get-netadapter "vEthernet (VmNat)" 
    | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.1 -AddressFamily IPv4 -PrefixLength 24
Each nested guest VM needs to have an IP address set and its gateway set as follows:
get-netadapter "Ethernet" 
   | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.2 -DefaultGateway 192.168.100.1 
                      -AddressFamily IPv4      -PrefixLength 24

## ADS Alternate Data Streams
embed one file into another
(Windows version of MACOS Forking)
originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.
For instance: the command
“type c:.exe > c:32.exe:anyfile.exe”
will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS “anyfile.exe.”
ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

## Bible Topics

Salvation
Salvation By Faith
Salvation is not by our own works but by the work of Christ on the cross
Salvation By Works
We are never saved by our good works
Good works
As Christians we should obey Christ unto good works, but they are not the vehicle for our salvation
Saved by keeping the 'law'
We can never be saved by keeping even the bible laws.  Christ asks us to trust in his finished work on the cross, and then through love and obedience to Christ we bring our lives into alignment with God's holy laws but we are not saved by them.  The greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself.
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.”  Romans 10:4 NKJV
Respect
        - We should respect other people's beliefs but that does not make them correct
Doctrine
        - It matters what you believe when it comes to Jesus and the message of salvation
Life
        - When does life begin?
            - videos of a baby developing

Ben & Jerry end serving in occupied territories of Judea and Samaria. Palestine as a country never even existed. This is actually biblical Judea and Samaria which is bible territory and is part of Israel all along. Jordan captured in 1948 then Israel captured it back from Jordan in 1967. Ben & Jerry ordered Zinger to stop serving the Israeli settlements. He refused so they won't renew their licence to him in 2023. McDonalds does not operate in Judea and Samaria. Padan operates 180 McDonalds in Israel and some are kosher. Padan supports 'peace now' which opposes Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem and Golan Heights. Human Rights Watch recycles claims of Israel flouting 'laws of war' and 'war crimes by Israel' focusing on 3 incidents where Palestinians were killed. Also accusing IDF of failing to investigate war violations committed in Gaza. 62 Palestinians were killed. Reports claim no military targets were present. First was caused by failed Palestinian rocket hitting 4 houses. Second Al-Shati refugee camp killing 10 civilians including children, a tragedy but IDF claims was also used as a 'terror infrastructure' claiming Hamas deliberately embeds military assets in densely populated civilian areas. Third was Gaza city and targeted underground terror tunnels and a terror command center. Military buildings collapsed but also unintended civilian buildings collapsed nearby. HRW also noted Palestinians launched more than 4360 unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli population centers which violate by being indiscriminate because they are not targeted therefore are launched against random civilian targets. Palestinian are war crimes, Israeli response is not. Palestinian target civilian, Israel target military.

```

MAC and Windows

download [git-scm.com/download](http://git-scm.com/download)

Windows

```powershell
# as administrator
# install chocolatey
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
# install git

```

## Basic Commands

```powershell
# version
git --version
# initialise a private git repo
git init
```

## git diff

```powershell
# view differences before git add
git diff
# view differences for one file
git diff HEAD file

# once in the file, navigate with
:return  next line
:space   next page
:q       quit
:w       previous page
:h       help

# check differences before git push
git diff --cached
```

### gitk

gitk - viewing proposed changes

```powershell
# Run gitk and view proposed changes
gitk
```

### GitHub Desktop

Use GitHub Desktop at [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) to visually see all changes first

## Hiding Secrets

Use this guide [https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25) to create a config file with the API keys in it, which is not published to github because it's inside the .gitignore file as well.

### git add

```powershell
# add file to staging area so that files are now tracked
gid add <file>
git add .
git add . --interactive to view changes as you push them

# show differences in files we have just added to the staging area
git diff --cached 

# check differences before commit
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
```

### git reset

```powershell
# before committing, git reset (no full stop) reverses the effect of git add
git reset
```

### git status

```powershell
# show differences between your folder and the staging area
git status
```

### git commit

```powershell
# commit our work as a point in time 'commit' to a local repository
git commit -m "Sample commit"

```

### .gitignore

to add a file to .gitignore which somehow is already being tracked, do the following

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree file
```



## Working With GitHub Online

### git clone

git clone can be used to clone a repository

```powershell
# copy a fresh copy of a remote repository down to the local machine, and initialise it ready for editing
git clone
```

### git remote

```powershell
# validate set up
git remote
# show url set up
git remote -v
git remote get-url --all origin
# set remote url
git remote set-url origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/test-project-3>
# or
git remote add origin 
    <https://github.com/philandersonsparta/testproject>
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### git push

```powershell
# to see a list of changed files before run git push
git diff --stat --cached origin/master

# see what will happen before you push
git push --dry-run   

# to set up git push one must first define the name of the remote branch to be created
git push --set-upstream origin -branch-name-
# push from local to remote repository
git push
```

### git pull

git pulls remote repo latest changes down into my local repo and merges changes

```
# pull down files from remote to local repository
git pull
```

### git config

git config can be used to configure which github account you are logged into

query user account with

```
git config --global -l    to list and check
```

Set user account details with the following

```
git config --global user.name 'Phil Anderson' 
git config --global user.email 'phil@anderson.com'
```

reset user and begin again

```
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

### git branch

The branches that need to be created are

- Master
- Dev
- Feature Branch

```
# create a branch
git branch branch_name

# create a new sub-branch off dev
git checkout -b new-branch-name dev

# delete a local-only branch 
git checkout master
git branch -D branch_name

# delete a branch if it's been pushed to remote repo also
git checkout master
git branch -d branch_name

# delete the branch you are on, and push this deletion to GitHub also
git push origin --delete branch_name

# delete a remote branch
git checkout master
git push origin --delete remote-branch-name


```

#### rename a branch

```powershell
git checkout old_name
git branch -m new_name
git push origin -u new_name
git push origin --delete old_name
```



### git checkout

```powershell
# move from one branch into another
git checkout branch_name
```

View the files in a particular commit

```powershell
# obtain the ID of the intended commit
git log
# move to this commit and look at the files
git checkout id
```

```powershell
# view all branches including hidden ones
git checkout -a
```

 
### git merge dev

If a dev branch has been updated in github then we need to bring our dev and feature branches into line with the dev branch online.

These steps will pull down and merge all changes.

```powershell
# Create branch dev if it does not exist
git branch dev

# Move to dev branch
git checkout dev

# pull down changes from dev on github to dev on local
git pull origin dev

# check code has pulled down
ls 

// switch to feature branch
git checkout phil-feature-branch-01

// merge changes from dev into this branch
git merge dev
```

## Viewing And Undoing Changes

### git log

git log can be used to view previous commits

```powershell
# view snapshots (commits)
git log

# git log with branching
git log --graph

# git log but summary data only
git log --oneline
```

### git reflog

```powershell
### git reflog

git reflog # display a list of commits with indexes.
```

### git reset —soft

Undo changes and reset the state of the disk back to a given commit point

```powershell
git reset --soft  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git reset —hard

Use this with extreme care as it wipes the files from your hard drive and they become irrecoverable

```powershell
# reset files on your hard disk back to your last commit point
git reset HEAD --hard 

# resets the files on disk to the state registered by this snapshot
git reset --hard  305bf485c68361d3a0ec97192998ea81a6673fbc
```

### git clean

Git clean can be used to remove untracked directories, which may still be hanging around and not been deleted properly when a checkout takes place and we no longer want those directories to be present

```powershell
// force removal of untracked directories
git clean -fd
```

### github tagging

GitHub tagging can allow you to commit a project at a certain state in time, and then preserve that state with definite tags in order to be able to recover the project again if needed.

This also works with GitHub releases.

Commits should be finished first, then tagging is done second.

```powershell
# show all tags
git tag
git show

# add a tag
git tag mytag

git tag -a "version-1.0" -m "detailed message about this version" 
git push origin --tags

```

## Other Git Commands

### Fixing a merge conflict

```powershell
# show conflict
git status
```

edit .md file and find `<<<<< ==== and >>>>` markers, edit and remove them

```powershell
# push changes
git push
```

### Change Git User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. You may be denied permissions to push and have to log out of the current user. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Protecting The Master Branch

Once we have created both master and dev branches we should protect the master from direct updates. All updates should now be done via the dev branch. Once updated, then a pull request gets submitted to allow work to be merged from the dev branch into the master branch, after approval.

1. Select master branch
2. Go into master branch settings
3. Choose 'Branches' on the left hand menu
4. Choose 'Add Rule'
5. Tick 'Require Pull Request Before Merging' and type in the name of the branch, ie 'master'
6. The master branch is now protected from direct updates.

### [Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

### Renaming A Branch

```powershell
# if you are on the branch you want to rename
git branch -m new-name
# if you are on another branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
# delete the old local and push the new branch
git push origin :old-name new-name
# point to new upstream branch
git push origin -u new-name
```

## Changing Github User

It may be that you are working on one git account and want to push under another account. Try this

```powershell
git config --local credential.helper ""
git push origin master
```

It should prompt for fresh credentials and allow a fresh push.

### Tag

```powershell
# list
git tag 
# add 
git tag -a TagName -m "message"
# push
git push origin --tags
```

## SSH

If you have set up SSH keys the commands with `https://` would be changed to

```powershell
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:philanderson888/repo.git 
# or
git remote add origin git@github.com:philanderson888/testproject
# then 
git push -u origin master
```

### Locating your SSH keys

SSH keys can be located at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or repo, settings, SSH keys 

### Keygen walkthrough

## Github With SSH

with GitBash

```powershell
ssh-keygen
# copy the public key to git respository
eval $(ssh-agent)
# add key with response 'identity added'
ssh-add my_private_key
# list 
ssh-add -l
# log in (responds with 'logged in as ..')
ssh -T git@..
```

powershell version

```powershell
# open Git bash shell
cd ~/.ssh
ls
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Generating public/private rsa key pair to file /Users/..../.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "philanderson888@hotmail.com"
# MAC key is saved in 
# /Users/apple/.ssh/id_rsa or change name of path and file
# Windows key is saved in 
# C:\Users\...\.ssh\ssh-key-01
# start the ssh-agent service to run in the background (Windows needs GitBash)
eval $(ssh-agent -s) 
# add key to ssh agent (use GitBash on Windows)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# verify keys added
ssh-add -l
# copy key to github (use GitBash on Windows)
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# add key (MAC)
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# or just copy then paste key into repo settings -> RSA Key -> New
# Finally to get this to work reset the origin to ssh 
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git 
# git push 
git push origin master
# Notice that if we get a git push - permission denied notice when we know the keys are already set up correctly then we can type in the eval and ssh-add commands again.
```

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part 1

As an indicator of how careful we have to be with `symmetric` encryption please run the following commands 

```powershell
# show wireless profile names
netsh wlan show profiles
# choose one
netsh wlan show profile name="name-of-wireless-profile" key=clear
```

You should see the WIFI password displayed in plain text.

If you are on a MAC then in the `terminal` please type

```bash
security find-generic-password -wa name-of-wireless-profile
```

##### Hacking Into Symmetric Encryption - Part II

Nobody uses default usernames and passwords these days - do they?

Well it's always worth a check!

Check your WIFI router model then head to `[routerpasswords.com](https://routerpasswords.com)`.  See what you can find!

       site providing sharing of data with site being authenticated
       



### Advanced Malware Attacks

TCP SYN Flood

TCP : Always send a '3-WAY HANDSHAKE' to set up

1) Hello : I'm going to send you data 2) Server : OK 3) Client : Done

SYN FLOOD : Send lots of 'hello' (stage 1) requests ONLY    Server : reserve space for conversations which never happen

Flood guard : watches for and prevents flood attacks (DOS flood)

Port Scan	Scanning network for all OPEN PORTS (free online port scan)	*** NOTE : THIS IS SEEN AS AN ATTACK **

XMAS Attack	Port Scan ==> ALL OF THE POSSIBLE 'FLAGS' SET TO 'HIGH' (1)
TO PROVOKE A RESPONSE

MITM Man In The Middle


Client			Bad Router 		Server

        Can be used 
        1) Eavesdrop : LISTEN (Passive)
        2) Alter packets in some way
                (Active)

Prevent : HTTPS Scanning (part of UTM Threat Management)



Session Hijack


Client---------------Bad Router----------------Server

    Bad router can actually 'take over' session

             Bad Router----------------Server

    Server THINKS STILL TALKING TO CLIENT BUT IS NOT: 
        BAD ROUTER IS IMPERSONATING AND HAS TAKEN
        OVER THE SESSION



Session Replay Attack


Valid session is copied and played back later

Client---------------Bad Router---------------Server

    later on Bad Router 'replay' same packets back to server
    to create a 'dummy' connection.

Mitigate using TIMESTAMPS

Watering Hole	Attacks on sites which are very popular and lots of people hanging around eg social media sites

Zero Day	Brand new software : Hackers discover weakness : exploit it before good guys get a fix

Cookie	Text file : tracking your browsing

Buffer Overflow Attack

Buffer 
    Temporary data store to hold information when network
    is slow : waiting for data to either send or receive

    Buffer data is stored in RAM of COMPUTER!

    Buffer Overflow attack ==> PUSH GOOD DATA OUT OF BUFFER,
        POSSIBLY GET ACCESS TO AREAS OF RAM NEXT TO 
        THE BUFFER WHICH NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

XSS Cross Site Scripting

Hack in to one website and from there, hack into another	



Folder Traversal Attack


Reach one folder : from there, navigate and reach another folder



XSRF Cross Site Request Forgery


Hack a website but ALREADY LOGGED IN ==> YOU HAVE MORE POWER
    TO DO MORE DAMAGE WHEN YOU HACK IN





#### CODE INJECTION ATTACK = APPLICATION ATTACK


CODE INJECTION ATTACK : CAN PUT <script>....code..</script>

    INTO A WEB FORM WHERE REGULAR TEXT IS EXPECTED

### XSS CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

    INJECTED CODE ATTEMPTS TO AFFECT OTHER SITES
    WHICH MAY BE 'HOSTED' ON SAME WEB SERVER


#### XSRF CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

    USER IS LOGGED IN ALREADY SO THIS CODE INJECTION
    PERHAPS HAS GREATER PERMISSIONS TO DO DAMAGE



    HOT FIX		SHORT-TERM FIX TO ISSUE	
    PATCH		FIX TO A FAULT

        SECURE RAM   |   BUFFER = SHORT TERM STORAGE
                 |		 AREA EG FOR HARD 
                         DRIVE
    
    BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK TRIES TO PUT SO MUCH DATA
        IN BUFFER, ATTACKING CODE REACHES SECURE
        AREA OF RAM

#### INJECTION TYPES
        SQL (DATABASE)

PORT


1.2.3.4 : 80

IP      : PORT

<--socket----->  		SOCKET = IP:PORT

WHAT IS A PORT???

    IT IS A CHANNEL BY WHICH DATA GETS SENT TO IP
        ADDRESS
    
        PICTURE : YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE OF 65000
            MAILBOXES IN ORDER TO GET 
            YOUR MAIL THROUGH!!!
    
        NOTE : HTTP ALWAYS PORT 80, HTTPS ALWAYS 443
    
    PORT 1-1000 ARE PRE-RESERVED FOR INTERNET USE
         1000+ CAN BE CONFIGURED BY USER
            EG GAMERS : SET PORT FORWARDING
                ON YOUR ROUTER SO GAMING
                TRAFFIC REACHES EG XBOX
    
    65536 VALID PORTS
