## 202410 cyber controls

- prevention
- deterrence
- detection
- correct during a live attack
- compensate by bypassing with an alternative action

## 202410 standards bodies

- nist national institute for standards and tech eg 800-53 baseline and nist sp800 control standards
  - csd computer security division
  - fips federal information processing standards eg fips 200
- cis center internet security
- sans institute for cyber training
- itil best practice frameworks eg iso-27001, iso-27002

## 202410 frameworks

framework is set of policies

compliance tests if policies are enacted

cisa certified information systems auditor

cism certified information systems manager

isms information security management system

iso 27001 provides risk management

itil best practice in service strategy, service design, service transition, service operation, service improvement

implementation of policies can be partial, risk informed, repeatable, adaptive with continuous improvement

security by default

cobit control objectives for it is a business framework to manage computers in business

togaf the open group architecture framework on the overall design of computer and security architecture and how it applies to a business

nist 800-137 continuous monitoring defines strategy for monitoring, continuous monitoring, collecting information, analysis, mitigate threats, update and improve 

## 202410 nist

nist has 5 core functions

identify eg risk assessment, managing of assets, goven, business environments, risk management strategies

protect from attack eg information processes, access control, user training, data security, maintenance

detect attacks and anomalies

respond to attacks with an irp plan, communication, analysis, mitigation

recover from attacks with cycle of improvement

## 202410 controls

access

audit

response

risk

technical controls include firewall, antivirus, permissions, auditing, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, encryption, motion detection, updating and patching operating system and software

operational controls such as training, security guards, configuration, contingency planning, response planning, maintenance, physical controls, media controls, clean desk policy, change management

management controls such as planning, risk assessment and authorisation, policies and procedures, user training, irp incident response policy, auditing, log management

hr responsible for hiring staff, job descriptions, policy and procedures

legal create non-disclosure agreements

marketing prepare press releases during an incident

physical controls eg alarm, lock, fence, cctv, mantrap, guards, badge, keypad, proximity card

logical controls eg antivirus, permissions, intrusion detection, passwords, biometric, smartcards, encryption, backups, group policy, least privilege, time of day restrictions, disabling generic accounts

admin controls eg policies and procedures, separation of duties, job rotation, disaster planning, security awareness training

operational controls such as policy, clean desk policy, disaster recovery policy, business continuity plan, procedures, acceptable use policy

cis control categories: hardware, software, vulnerabilities, admin privileges, client security, servers, logs, email, browser, malware, network, data, firewall, router, switch, boundary, training, apps, incident response, pen tests

auditing checks if controls are in place

risk assessment to monetise the risk and mitigate the risk

vulnerability assessment pays for penetration test to probe for weaknesses eg firewall, physical, software, services

change management looks at cost of change, risk of change, rollback procedures, approval

configuration management looks at predictability and version control

preventative controls aim to stop attack eg server hardening, create security baseline configurations for firewall, group policy, services, apps, data, security awareness training, separation of duties, biometrics, encryption, mantrap, badge, guards

preventative controls also include training, guards, disabling unused accounts

detective controls detect after the event eg logs, system logs, video, job rotation, auditing, cctv, guards, monitoring and alerts

corrective controls eg intrusion detection and prevention and restoring a backup

deterrent controls such as warning signs, video cameras

compensating controls propose a different course of action to the default eg one time password if smart card is not operational, take a system offline, restore corrupted data from a backup

access controls eg rbac role based access, rule based access eg no log on at certain hours, dacl discretionary access based on user groups, mac mandatory access eg top secret, secret, restricted, confidential, unclassified using selinux

recovery controls return to normal function eg drp disaster recovery planning, recovery of data backup, alternate sites

indicator is a pattern of observables

threat actor 

campaign is series of attacks

ioc indicators of compromise what has been attacked

severity eg services were degraded ie partially affected, or interrupted with full taking down of a service 

downtime

category

response time critical immediate, urgent which is 24 hours, normal which is 7 days

has data been affected and if so how much and what has happened to the data

economic effect of the incident

recovery time

criticality of the system under attack

```bash
dd if=/dev/sda/ of=/mnt/usbstick/backup.img
```

## 202410 hashing

sha secure hash algorithm

sha-1 160 bits

sha-256/512 used in ipsec and ssl

mda-5 older and not totally rock solid but much faster than sha so is often used in many tools as a quick solution

```bash
certutil -hashfile md5/sha1/sha512

fciv file checksum integrity verifier

md5sum/sha1sum/sha512sum -c to compare file with a hash
```

## ADS Alternate Data Streams

embed one file into another 

(Windows version of MACOS Forking)

originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.

For instance: the command

“type c:.exe > c:32.exe:anyfile.exe”

will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS “anyfile.exe.”

ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

File Fork - split up files into multiple parts, but the OS treats them as one file and will track the position of each relative part of the file. Also can be looked on as data sets hidden inside one file.

## ADS Alternate Data Streams

embed one file into another 

(Windows version of MACOS Forking)

originally conceived as a way to use Forking in the same way as the MAC OS, Windows permits basically embedding one file into another without having traditional methods detect that a file has been embedded. Also when the embedded file is run, the process shows only of the host running so there is no way of knowing which is the real and which is the embedded process at work. Only way of detecting and defeating is by HASHING the files and also by using dedicated ADS trackers.

For instance: the command

“type c:.exe > c:32.exe:anyfile.exe”

will fork the common windows calculator program with an ADS “anyfile.exe.”

ADS can be queried using powershell get-object abc.txt -stream

File Fork - split up files into multiple parts, but the OS treats them as one file and will track the position of each relative part of the file. Also can be looked on as data sets hidden inside one file.

## Hashing

shasum -a 512 myfile.txt  on MAC	

To find the hash of a string in LINUX type

```bash
echo -n 'phil' | shasum 
echo -n "yourstring" |md5sum
echo -n "yourstring" |sha1sum
echo -n "yourstring" |sha256sum
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA512

### hping3

ddos attack

(( spamhouse don't route - don't route these packets))

## mac overflow attack

Flood switch buffer memory (CAM = Content Addressable Memory) so it's full and cannot resolve addresses which causes the switch to default to sending out traffic on all ports which is very dangerous and not secure
