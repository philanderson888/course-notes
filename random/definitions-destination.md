functional programming 
    uses declarative rather than imperative
        imperative - how to do this, step by step
        declarative - just give the end goal
    avoids sharing state
    uses immutable data
    pure functions
        deterministic gives same output for given input






## kotlin

flux is a stream
flow is like a stream with a callback on events onNext, onCompleted, onError
val is immutable
var is mutable
function fun(a: Int, b: Int): Int { return ab } same as {}
lambda { a: Int, b: Int => ab }
