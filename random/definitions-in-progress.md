Hello I am dropping off this leaflet as it is spare and surplus to my requirements and I thought you might enjoy a read and be challenged in your faith - I don't know if you have a faith or not, if you have a religion or not, whether you believe in God or not... Regardless I would like to encourage you to read through the material provided and pass it on when you are done or return it to me 3 Picardy House thanks üôè do you believe there is a heaven? Are you going there?
Love in Christ Jesus and if I can be of any help let me know
