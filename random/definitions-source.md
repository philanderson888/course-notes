## feasts

His death, burial and resurrection and His blood at  "Feast of Passover" ,

He paid for our sin "Feast of Unleavened bread"

He gave us His Spirit at "Feast of Pentacost."

We shout , blow trumpets and warn  people He is returning soon at "Feast of Trumpets"

We spend a day solely praying to realign our hearts to God/Yahweh ready for our personal judgement at "Feast of Atonement"

We spend 8 days  feasting, partying, dancing, and having joy celebrating Gods 7 day creation , the coming marriage of Christ and the Bride (us the church) and the coming 1000yr reign and new heaven and earth.
