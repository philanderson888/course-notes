went to kicc for a while - great church

london was not a nice experience

london was not a nice place to live

left kicc

joined the korean church playing the piano, very badly, but it was beautiful

left that when god spoke to me that i would go crazy ... joined the potters

potters was a hostile environment from the start - isaac in particular opposed my even coming to the church

met zoe and married her

kingsley and isaac were my alter egos and caused me great trouble and pain, and kazeem also in mockery from the band ...

struggled and gained a ministry in the elderly peoples - created a ministry from scratch and ran with it, gaining the much love and group dynamics from the faithful people who were a part of it - it really flowed in prayer and the power of the lord really moved
