Network models

```
Domain

	Central Server “DOMAIN CONTROLLER” (DC)

		Windows ==> Active Directory creates domain

	Multimaster model : each DC has full rights to update
			domain database e.g. new user, group etc

	PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP

Client/Server

		Temporary e.g. online banking

Workgroup

		DEFAULT ==> no server at all, just clients on network

Peer-to-peer

	COMMON TO SHARE WORKLOAD

		e.g.  WINDOWS UPDATES ==> DOWNLOADED TO WIN10 
		BUT SHARED WITH PEOPLE A) LAN B) INTERNET	
		((Old days ==> ONE CENTRAL SERVER, GET FILES FROM
					SERVER EG WITH FTP (FILE TRANSFER 											PROTOCOL)
		Peer-to-peer : CHOP FILE INTO SEEDS.  DOWNLOAD
				SEEDS.   CAN SHARE SEEDS WITH OTHERS.

```

LAN
Client ==> Switch ==> Router ==> ((Modem))

WAN

```
Client => Switch => Router => Modem —————dial up———

				ISP Router ———> INTERNET

```

WAN with VPN

```
							encrypted tunnel
LAN1==> Router1==================Router2 => LAN2

		All machines on LAN1 share same GATEWAY which
			is Router1.   They connect through this to LAN2

```

PAN
Personal Area Network

```
	BLUETOOTH : DIRECT CONNECTION

			EG PRINT TO PRINTER OVER BLUETOOTH

			((TODAY WIFI DIRECT ALSO DOES THIS))

```

MAN
Metropolitan : city-wide e.g. Hospital/Bank/University

```
			((usually. FIBER OPTIC))

```

LAN COMPONENTS

```
Hub

	FIRST EVER LAN DEVICE

		Good

		Bad
			BROADCASTS ALL DATA ON EVERY PORT

		Speed 10Mbps max, 

				1/n. For every device.   1/5 for 5 Devices

```

Bridge

```
Used to connect 2 NETWORKS OF DIFFERENT TYPES

		Ethernet == BRIDGE == Token Ring

```

Repeater

```
Ethernet 100m MAX

                 100m                          repeater          100m
	|<—————————————>|<——————————->

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10Mbps. :  MADE THICK COAX CALLED “ THICKNET  ”

this changed to 

 10Mbps. THINNET (common TV cable of today)

```

7 Layer Model Of Networking

```
Used 1) Theory 2) Real world

1. 	Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

Layer 1 : Physical
	
		ANYTHING YOU CAN TOUCH

		CABLING
						COPPER
									COAX
									ETHERNET
						FIBER
		PORTS
		

Layer 2 : Data Link

		DEALS WITH GETTING DATA ROUND OUR LAN

			USE UNIQUE ETHERNET ADDRESS
								  (MAC address)
								(Physical address)

								IPCONFIG ==> SHOW IP address
								IPCONFIG /ALL.  ==> SHOW MAC address

		MAC address IS UNIQUE ON LAN

				TWO PARTS

				1ST HALF : OUI : NAME OF COMPANY WHICH BUILT 
										                     CARD
								((OUI  organisationally unique id))

				2nd HALF : UNIQUE ID SO FULL MAC address IS
									UNIQUE

	    SWITCH

				Inspect ‘to’ address of ETHERNET ‘FRAME’

		ETHERNET FRAME

				Preamble : notification that data is following
				To : 
				From:
				Data :   1500 bytes max
				CRC. : 	Error check (( check data not lost in transit)

		SWITCH : INSPECT ‘TO’ ADDRESS

				create SWITCHING TABLE

				PHYSICAL			MAC 
				PORT

				1							AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF
				2							….

			Data arrives : check ‘to’ address and see if there is a match
					in switching table

					IF MATCH : SEND OUT ON THAT PORT
					IF NO MATCH : BROADCAST ON ALL PORTS

										((ETHERNET : FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
                                             All one’s broadcast address))

Layer 3 : Network Layer

		Layer 1 ; cabling etc
		Layer 2 : LOCAL LAN ONLY
		Layer 3 : IP CAN TALK TO GLOBAL INTERNET

				Public 
							VALID ANYWHERE ON INTERNET
							(( our address ==> WHATISMYIP ))
								((THIS IS OUR LAN ROUTER == GATEWAY ))
				Private
						4 ranges
							1)	10.X.Y.Z
							2) 172.16.Y.Z - 172.31.Y.Z
							3)	192.168.X.Y
							4) APIPA	   169.254.X.Y.  when DHCP NOT
										                            WORKING

									((DHCP : dynamic host configuration 
											protocol : job is to GIVE IP address
											TO CLIENT MACHINES))
											ipconfig /release
											ifconfig /renew.      GET NEW IP
										                                   ADDRESS	

Layer 3 : ROUTING

		ROUTING DOES TWO THINGS
	
			1) CREATE FAST ROUTES (CHANNELS) FOR DATA TO 
											                   FLOW
						((Think : build road infrastructure in a country))	

			2) SEND DATA

		ROUTING PROTOCOL

				SOFTWARE WORKING ON ROUTERS

				ENABLE ONE ROUTER TO TALK WITH ANOTHER
						ROUTER AND SHARE ‘BEST ROUTES’

				EG 
					RIP
					EIGRP
					OSPF
					BGP

				A) RIP : Routing Internet Protocol

						RIPV2. Is in use now
						Uses ‘HOPS’ to measure distance

								((Look at.  PING/ PATHPING / TRACERT))

										                          ((TRACEROUTE LINUX))
				
							HOP COUNT == ‘METRIC’.  (MEASUREMENT 
											OF DISTANCE ACROSS INTERNET)

					RIP : BAD POINTS : EVERY 30 SECONDS IT WILL
							BROADCAST TO ALL ROUTERS ITS FULL
							ROUTING TABLE!!!!    Creating NOISE!!!

				2). EIGRP.    ((Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing 
											Protocol))		
							CISCO
										HOPS FOR DISTANCE											DATA SENT 1-1 UNICAST
										ONLY CHANGES SENT
				

				3) OSPF. Open Shortest Path First

						SPLIT WORLD INTO ‘AREAS’
		
							((think paper letter : to S.America=> Brazil => 
										Sao Paulo => District => Street => 5))

					EVERY COMPANY GETS GLOBAL ID : SEND DATA TO 
					THIS ID AND INTERNALLY COMPANY CREATE 
					AREAS TO GET DATA TO FINAL DESTINATION

			4)   BGP BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL : BACKBONE (
						Fast Internet )

	Layer 4 : Transport Layer

			Layer 1 : Cabling
			Layer 2 : Local Network
			Layer 3 : Global IP

			Layer 3 lacks CHECKING THAT DATA HAS ARRIVED

			Layer 4 provides two fields 

				1) SEQUENCE NUMBER : 1,2,3,4,5,… COUNT PACKETS
										                                        OUT
				2) ACK (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT) 1,2,3,4,5.  RECEIVER 
								CAN LET SENDER KNOW DATA ARRIVED

				SEND 5 PACKETS : SEQ 1,2,3,4,5 
				RECEIVER : ACK 1,2,4,5
				SENDER : PACKET 3 MISSING : RESEND 3
				RECEIVER : ACK 3

		TCP : 3-WAY HANDSHAKE TO BEGIN
				1) Sender : are you ready?  2) Receiver : yes 3) Sender : 
										                  Let’s begin

				TCP : SLOW!!!

		UDP : CAN BE USED IF NO CHECKING NEEDED

				User Datagram Protocol

				FAST BUT NO CHECKING : USEFUL EG 
										YOUTUBE/STREAMING

		TCP : CHECK (SLOW)
		UDP : FAST BUT NO CHECK

	Layer 5 : Session

		CREATES ‘FLOW/STREAM OF DATA TO/FROM COMPUTER’

		EG. 5 tabs in browser: each playing same Youtube video

				==> SESSION LAYER SORT STREAMS

	 Layer 6 : Presentation

			1) ENCRYPTION

			2) COMPRESSION

					e.g. WAV audio => compress to MP3
						   RAW/BMP image ==> compress to JPG
							WMV         ==> MP4

		Layer 7 : Application Layer

				PROGRAM EG OUTLOOK WHICH REQUESTS ACCESS 									TO NETWORK

```

Switching Table

```
View on PC

			arp -a

						ARP Address Resolution Protocol

						Map IP to Mac

```

Routing Table

```
	windows : view with ROUTE PRINT

```

Modem

```
Mo			Modulate
Dem			Demodulate

		Modulate ==> create a WAVE

	PC (101010 BINARY). ==> MODEM ==> create wave to send on 
										                               phone line

     CABLE MODEM : CSU/DSU.  (DIGITAL LINES)

```

IP address : Port

```
	Every address on the web has an IP:PORT convention

		IP : think of IP address as a MEDIEVAL SECURE CASTLE

				NO ACCESS UNLESS USE APPROVED CHANNEL

		PORTS : 2^16 CHANNELS = 65536

			1-1000 FIXED
			1000+.  FREE FOR USE BY ANYONE
			
		Most companies use a limited range of ports
		
			FREE ONLINE PORT SCAN

```

FIREWALL

```
	BLOCK BY

		1) IP
		2) PORT
		3) PROTOCOL TCP/UDP

```

PATCH PANEL

```
	Client PC ==> WIRED CONNECTION TO WALL SOCKET ==> 

				through wall ==> hard wired in at the rear of PATCH 
								PANEL (punchdown block)

				FRONT OF PATCH PANEL : CONNECT PORT INTO 
					SWITCH AND GO LIVE

```

SERVER ROLES

```
FILE SERVER

		SHARE : CREATED USING SMB. (Server message block)

				((UPGRADE : CIFS Common Internet Filing System))

				\\\\server\\share	  UNC path.  Uniform Naming Convention 

			NOTE : VSS : VOLUME SHADOW COPY : Enable ‘instant’
						snapshot backups of volume, very common on shared
						volumes

Packet Switch vs Circuit Switch

	Circuit switch

		one wire ==> all electricity can only go down one wire
				(phone line)

			no choice!!!

		Circuit switched path ==> fixed path, signal has no choice				
		Virtual circuit eg during phone call : create it but then
			fix it for that call.  

			PVC permanent
			SCV switched temporary  (inside switch)

	Packet switch

		Each router is INDEPENDENT

			Each IP packet makes OWN WAY TO DESTINATION

		No fixed route!!!

	
Carrying data quickly inside eg BT

	Old	
		1) X25		BAD ANSWER LIKE HUB/WEP

		2) Frame Relay	

				UniqueID for routes   DLCI Data Link Connection
								ID

		3) MPLS  currently  Multi Protocol Layer Switch

		===> THESE GIVE CIR Commited Info Rate ie guaranteed speed

# Networking Flow 3 (Win 10 Networking)

Networking

Network models

```
Domain

	Central server = DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		Clients 'join' the domain and come under
		the umbrella of central security

		MULTIMASTER = MANY DOMAIN CONTROLLERS, ALL
		FULFILLING SAME FUNCTION 

		ACTIVE DIRECTORY = PROGRAM IN WINDOWS TO
		CREATE A DOMAIN AND RUN A DOMAIN CONTROLLER

		PERMANENT : CLIENTS JOIN AND STAY JOINED

Client - Server  relationship

	EG LOG IN TO OUR BANK

PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK

	WINDOWS CLIENTS ON SAME NETWORK BUT NO CENTRAL 
			SERVER TO MANAGE THEM

		NO CENTRAL SECURITY
		NO BACKUPS ...

		OK FOR HOME OR SMALL OFFICE 

			SOHO = SMALL OFFICE, HOME OFFICE

	'WORKGROUP' = WINDOWS PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK

```

LAN LOCAL AREA NETWORK

```
PC

SWITCH  (CENTRAL DEVICE)

SERVER

WIFI

ROUTER (TO INTERNET)

```

WAN WIDE AREA NETWORK

```
LAN1 + ROUTER ---> DIAL UP --> ISP

	ISP = INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER

	ISP --> ROUTER --> CONNECT TO FAST PART OF INTERNET

		CALLED 'BACKBONE' OF INTERNET

	==> CONNECT EG TO ANOTHER LAN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

			    VPN
LAN1===across internet--((encrypt))====LAN2

```

PAN PERSONAL AREA NETWORK : BLUETOOTH NETWORK

MAN METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK : ACROSS A CITY

```
UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

PC - SWITCH - ROUTER1 ======VPN_TUNNEL=====ROUTER2--->LAN2  

|---unencrypted-----|-----encrypted--------|---unencrypted

AT ROUTER, 'DIAL UP' TO ANOTHER IP ADDRESS (THIS WOULD
	BE ANOTHER ROUTER).  SET OUR ENCRYPTION.
	CREATE 'TUNNEL' TO SEND DATA, ENCRYPTED, TO THAT
	OTHER IP ADDRESS.

DIAL-UP

	PPP
	PPPoE

VPN
	PPTP
	L2TP
	SSTP
	IKEV2

```

NETWORK COMPONENTS

HUB

```
FIRST EVER NETWORKS CREATED USED HUBS

PURELY FORWARD ELECTICITY ARRIVING AT ONE PORT, 
SEND OUT SAME PULSES ON ALL OTHER PORTS

---->IN---HUB===> OUT (SAME SIGNAL)

THIS WAS GOOD FOR SMALL NETWORKS.

TODAY HUBS ARE TERRIBLE.

	BECAUSE ==> BROADCAST TRAFFIC TO ALL DEVICES ALWAYS

		CREATE 'NOISE' ON NETWORK

	((UNICAST = 1-1))
	((BROADCAST = 1 TO MANY))		

SPEED OF HUB = 10Mbps

BUT DECREASES WITH N DEVICES TO 1/N SPEED

10 DEVICES ==> 1/10 SPEED (AT BEST)

```

BRIDGE

```
OLD, WAS USED TO CONNECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NETWORKS

	EG TOKEN RING FROM IBM TO ETHERNET

	(WORKS AT LAYER 2)

```

REPEATER

```
LIKE HUB 

ONLY GOT 2 PORTS 

JUST USED TO EXTEND LENGTH OF A NETWORK

EG

ETHERNET 100M MAX LENGTH

	100M : REPEATER : 100M 

	-----200m total-------

	
5-4-3 rule : 5 NETWORKS WITH 4 REPEATERS BUT ONLY 3 CAN 
		HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEM!

```

FIRST NETWORKS

```
10 MBPS  : USED THICK COAX CABLE CALLED 'THICKNET'  

THEN

10 MBPS  : THINNET (STILL COAX) - LIKE TV CABLE TODAY

THEN

ETHERNET : 10/100/1000/10000 MBPS TODAY!!!

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
PHYSICAL

	GETTING SIGNAL FROM PC TO NEXT DEVICE

		COPPER : ETHERNET OR COAX (TV)
		WIFI   : 
		LIGHT  : FIBER OPTIC
		

DATA LINK

	DATA ROUND LAN???

		MAC ADDRESS  

			SHOW WITH IPCONFIG /ALL    OR  GETMAC

			AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF  

			EACH CHARACTER REPRESENTS 4 BITS
			TOTAL = 4 X 12 = 48 BITS LONG ADDRESS

			FIRST HALF : OUI 

		ETHERNET PROTOCOL USES 'FRAMES'

					     |  HEADER------------->
		|CRC|---DATA-----------------| SOURCE MAC | DEST MAC|

		JOB OF SWITCH 

			LOOK AT DESTINATION MAC : LOOKUP IF THIS
			MAC ADDRESS IS ATTACHED TO SWITCH.  SEND.
			'VIRTUAL CIRCUIT'

NETWORK

	
TRANSPORT
SESSION
PRESENTATION
APPLICATION

```

7 LAYER MODEL OF NETWORKING

```
USED BY STUDENTS AND REAL-WORLD ENGINEERS!

LAYER 1 PHYSICAL

	SENDING OUT ELECTICAL PULSES

	WIRE : COPPER OR FIBER

	WIFI : WIFI SIGNAL

	ENCODE : SEND DATA OUT IN FORMAT SO IT CAN 
		GET FROM A TO B WITHOUT LOSING 
		DEFINITION OF SIGNAL

	PHYSICAL NETWORK PORT

LAYER 2 DATA LINK

	LOCAL LAN TRAFFIC

	EACH DEVICE HAS A UNIQUE ADDRESS CALLED A 'MAC
	ADDRESS'

		MAC = MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

	EACH MAC ADDRESS IS UNIQUE

		2 PARTS : COMPANY ID + UNIQUE PART

			  (( OUI ))

	VIEW MAC ADDRESS ==> IPCONFIG /ALL

LAYER 3 NETWORK

	LAYER 1  : PHYSICAL
	LAYER 2  : LOCAL ADDRESSES (LAN ONLY)

	LAYER 3  : GLOBAL ADDRESSING SCHEME VALID ACROSS
		   ENTIRE WORLD : UNIQUE ADDRESSES IDENTIFY
		   COMPUTERS

		   EG GOOGLE SERVER AT 173.194.116.193

```

LAYER 2 : LAN ADDRESS : MAC ADDRESS : PHYSICAL ADDRESS : ETHERNET PROTOCOL

LAYER 3 : GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

```
MAC ADDRESS : VALID ON LAN ONLY

IP ADDRESS : VALID GLOBALLY (IF YOU PAY FOR ONE!) 

	PRIVATE IP : FREE, INTERNAL USE

		10.X.Y.Z, 172.16-172.31.Y.Z , 192.168.X.Y

		(( APIPA   169.254.X.Y  ==> DHCP NOT WORKING))

	ROUTERS ALSO WORK HERE

		TALK TO OTHER ROUTERS : CREATE PATHS
		ACROSS THE WORLD FOR FASTEST WAY TO GET
		DATA FROM A TO B

		CREATE 'ROUTING TABLE' OF BEST ROUTES

		DATA COMES IN ==> DATA SENT DOWN BEST ROUTE

```

ROUTING PROTOCOLS

```
ROUTERS TALK TO EACH OTHER.  THEY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
	ROUTES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT.  THEY USE THIS TO 
	BUILD 'BEST ROUTES' ROUND THE INTERNET

ROUTING PROTOCOL IS A LANGUAGE THAT ROUTERS USE TO TALK 
	TO EACH OTHER

RIP   ROUTING INFORMATION PROTOCOL

	OLDEST PROTOCOL

	'BROADCAST' BASED ==> WHOLE ROUTING TABLE GETS
	SENT OUT TO ALL ROUTERS EVERY 30 SECONDS	

	(EVEN IF NO CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE)

METRIC = WAY TO MEASURE STUFF

	MEASURES DISTANCE IN 'HOPS'

	ONE HOP = ONE ROUTER 'BOUNCE' ALONG THE WAY

	BEST ROUTES CHOSEN WITH LOWEST 'HOP' COUNT

EIGRP

	CISCO : SIMILAR BUT FASTER AND ONLY SEND OUT DATA
	IF CHANGES ARE PRESENT

OSPF

	DIVIDES THE WORLD INTO 'AREAS' LIKE CONTINENTS AND
	COUNTRIES.  SEND DATA TO AN AREA, THEN SUB-AREA ETC

	AUSTRALASIA => AUSTRALIA => WEST => MELBOURNE 
		==> STREET => HOUSE NUMBER

BGP
	BACKBONE OF INTERNET (FAST)
	
	
	
	
	
	
LAYER 4 TRANSPORT

	LAYER 3 : IP PACKETS  BUT PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT

		- LIKE A REGULAR POSTMAN - THERE IS NO 
			RECORD OF DELIVERY 

		"CONNECTIONLESS" 

	LAYER 4 : TCP TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

		- COUNT AND CHECK ALL PACKETS IN AND OUT

		==> SENDING : OUT : USE A 'SEQ' SEQUENCE NUMBER

		==> CONFIRMING RECEIPT : USE AN 'ACK'
				ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBER

			SEND : SEQ : 3,4,5,6,7
			       ACK : 3,4,6, 7

			ACK PACKETS SENT BACK TO ORIGINAL 
			SENDER.  SENDER FLAGGED THAT PACKET
			5 HAS GONE MISSING

			PACKET 5 RESENT!!!

		" BETTER SLOW DATA THAN NO DATA "

			TCP IS SLOWER BUT PEACE OF MIND
			DATA IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING

		TCP : CHECKS

		UDP : USED WHERE NO CHECKING REQUIRED

			(BLANK, DUMMY PROTOCOL)

			UDP ==> VERY FAST!!
		
			EG STREAMING RADIO STATION

LAYER 5 SESSION

	CREATES AND MANAGES 'SESSIONS' OR 'STREAMS OF TRAFFIC'

	EG SKYPE + EMAIL + TEXT CHAT + BROWSE INTERNET : ALL
		TRAFFIC GETS PUT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION

	EG MULTIPLE TABS ON A BROWSER

LAYER 6 PRESENTATION

	COMPRESS DATA

		EG WAV (UNCOMPRESSED) ==> MP3/WEBM
	
	ENCRYPT DATA

LAYER 7 APPLICATION

	PROGRAM WHICH IS REQUESTING ACCESS TO NETWORK
	EG OUTLOOK OR SKYPE ETC

```

SWITCHES

```
LAYER 2 DEVICE

FILTER ALL TRAFFIC USING 'MAC ADDRESS' OF EVERY DEVICE
	ATTACHED

BUILD UP A 'SWITCHING TABLE' OF ALL CONNECTED DEVICES

PORT		MAC ADDRESS

1		30-85-A9-9A-6B-B5
2		00-50-56-C0-00-01
3		00-50-56-C0-00-08

ETHERNET PACKET GETS SENT FROM A DEVICE TO SWITCH

|-----data--------------|SOURCE MAC |  DESTINATION MAC |
				       00-50-56-C0-00-08

			|---------header---------------|

	==> SWITCH CHECKS TABLE AND IN THIS INSTANCE
		FINDS A MATCH ON PORT 3 SO WILL FORWARD
		ETHERNET PACKET TO DEVICE ON PORT 3

IEEE 802.3 ==> ETHERNET STANDARD 

```

CABLE SPEEDS

```
CAT 3		10Mbps
CAT 5		100Mbps     *** FAST ETHERNET ***
CAT 5E		1000Mbps
CAT 6		10000Mbps
POE		DELIVERS POWER DOWN WIRE AS WELL AS SIGNAL

		POE = POWER OVER ETHERNET

ACCESS POINT

```
WIFI ACCESS POINT IS AN AERIAL CONNECTED TO WIRED NETWORK
	WHEREBY WIRELESS DEVICES CAN TALK TO WIRED NETWORK

TODAY : ROAMING WIRELESS WITH MULTIPLE POINTS FOR 
			CONVENIENCE

```

MODEM

```
MODEM = 'MODULATE-DEMODULATE'

	MODULATE : SEND A DIGITAL SIGNAL ONTO AN ANALOGUE
			WIRE AS A WAVE SIGNAL

	PC (1011000)====>MODEM====>PHONE LINE (WAVE)

	 DIGITAL                    ANALOGUE

	DEMODULATE = RETURN BACK TO DIGITAL SIGNAL

```

IP ADDRESS : PORT

```
EACH IP ADDRESS IS LIKE A SECURE CASTLE WITH 65536 SECURE
	ENTRY POINTS

	YOU CAN'T SEND DATA INTO THIS DEVICE WITHOUT 		
	USING ONE OF THESE CHANNELS

	EG WEB TRAFFIC : HTTP : USES PORT 80 (EVEN IF NOT 
					STATED)		

			 HTTPS : USES PORT 443

	SEND EMAIL : USE SMTP PROTOCOL : USES PORT 25

	FTP DOWNLOAD : USES PORT 20/21

	REMOTE DESKTOP : 3389

PORTS 1-1000    FIXED BY NETWORKING OFFICIAL USES

PORTS 1000+     CAN BE USED BY ANYONE!

	EG GAMERS!!!

```

FIREWALL

```
BLOCK OR PERMIT ALL IP TRAFFIC GOING INTO AND OUT OF 
	YOUR ROUTER

	FILTER ON 

		IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER

		EG *:22 WILL BLOCK ALL TRAFFIC FROM 
			ALL IP ADDRESSES ON PORT 22 (SSH)

		   1.2.3.4:22 PERMIT ALL

```

PATCH PANEL

```
PC ==> PLUG INTO WALL ==> ALL WIRES GO BEHIND WALL AND
	       MEET AT ONE POINT.

	PATCH PANEL TAKES RAW WIRES AT THIS POINT

	AND WIRES THEM UP 	

PUNCHDOWN BLOCK

NETWORKING : TCP/IP

```
WHAT'S THE POINT OF TCP/IP???

	COLD WAR : RUSSIA VS US

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK WITH FOLLOWING
		CHARACTERISTICS

	1) NODES WERE INDEPENDENT AND NOT CENTRALLY MANAGED

	2) TRAFFIC GETS FROM A TO B WITH ROUTING AGAIN 
		NOT DICTACTED CENTRALLY BUT LOCAL 
		ROUTING DECISIONS TAKEN 'AUTONOMOUSLY'

	GOAL WAS TO CREATE A ROBUST NETWORK THAT COULD
	AUTOMATICALLY SURVIVE A NUCLEAR WAR WITH WHOLE 
	CITIES GOING OUT.  NETWORK WOULD SURVIVE AND RE-ROUTE
	ON SURVIVING NODES

ROUTABLE PROTOCOL : CAN SEND DATA ROUND WORLD

	NON-ROUTABLE PROTOCOLS ARE LOCAL LAN ONLY

		EG 

			ETHERNET
			NETBIOS   (USES HOST NAME ONLY)
			APPLETALK

	2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

```

DHCP

```
GET IP ADDRESS AT STARTUP

LEASE : IP LASTS FOR 8 DAYS 

RESERVATION : MANUALLY TYPE IN MAC ADDRESS AND FIX IP 

DHCP PROCESS

	COMPUTER BOOTS (NEVER HAD IP)

	BROADCAST DHCPREQUEST 'I NEED IP'
	
	SERVER : DHCP OFFER IP

	CLIENT PC : ACCEPT OFFER

	SERVER : CONFIRM  DHCPACK   ACKNOWLEDGE	

	....

	LEASE TIME/2 ==> 4 DAYS

	CLIENT : REQUEST TO RENEW

			
BOOTP WAS PRIMITIVE FORERUNNER TO DHCP 

	BOOTP = DHCP

DHCP RELAY AGENT : DHCP SERVER : TO AVOID PUTTING ONE SERVER
	FOR EVERY SWITCH, YOU CAN SET YOUR ROUTERS TO FORWARD
	DHCP REQUESTS TO THE ONE DHCP SERVER ON YOUR LAN

	((ROUTERS DEFAULT DON'T TRANSMIT DHCP BROADCASTS))

	
	CLIENT=============SWITCH========ROUTER--------INTERNET
	        BROADCAST          ==>

	ROUTER : CONFIGURE A DHCP RELAY AGENT 
		UNICAST FORWARD TRAFFIC TO NAMED DHCP SERVER
		ON CONNECTED NETWORK

		
		

APIPA ADDRESS

	DHCP GIVES OUT AN IP ADDRESS TO A COMPUTER

	DHCP WORKING ==> GET AN IP ADDRESS

	BUT

		IF DHCP FAILS, THEN WHAT HAPPENS???

	WINDOWS DETECTS THIS AND SELF-ASSIGNS AN ADDRESS

	169.254.X.Y

		X,Y RANDOM ==> CHECK FIRST IF THIS ALREADY
				ALLOCATED

	APIPA  AUTOMATIC PRIVATE IP ADDRESS

STATIC IP IS MANUALLY FIXED

DYNAMIC IP IS DHCP FLEXIBLE (AUTOMATIC)

```

WAN CONNECTIONS

```
ISP
	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER

CABLE 

	TV CHANNELS PLUS ON TOP DELIVERS BROADBAND ALSO

DIAL-UP

	OLDEST 

	PLAIN PHONE LINE

	MODEM 'DIALS UP' (THINK SCREECH FAX NOISE)

	'HOGS' WHOLE PHONE LINE

	ANALOGUE!

ADSL

	GOING OUT OF FASHION IN FAVOUR OF FIBER/CABLE

	VERY IMPORTANT

	USING STANDARD PHONE LINE

		CONVERT ==> BOTH PHONE AND BROADBAND

		ONE LINE ==> TWO FREQUENCIES

		1) VOICE (HUMAN) 0-500

		2) DIGITAL BROADBAND ABOUT 20 000 HZ 

	ONE LINE BOTH SIGNALS

	MUST HAVE A 'FILTER' OR 'SPLITTER' AT BOTH ENDS

	ANALOGUE!!!

ISDN 

	ISDN IS DIGITAL PHONE LINE

	USED ON MAINSTREAM TELECOMS COMPANIES EG BT

	ONE WIRE CARRIES 64K OF DATA !!! 

	TWO WIRES       128KBPS   ==> ISDN BRI BASIC RATE
	23 WIRES        1.5MBPS   ==> ISDN PRI PRIMARY RATE
	  (ONE WIRE ADMIN)

	480 WIRES       45MBPS          DS3

```

OTHER PORTS AND PROTOCOLS

```
LDAP

	LIGHTWEIGHT DIRECTORY ACCESS PROTOCOL

	ACTIVE DIRECTORY IS BUILT USING LDAP

		BUILDS A CENTRAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
	
	CN=PHIL,OU=EMPLOYEES,DC=MYDOMAIN,DC=COM

SNMP

	SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

	50 ROUTERS : ARE THEY ALL RUNNING?

	SNMP ALLOWS US TO :

	1) 	INSTALL CLIENT 'AGENT' SOFTWARE ON 
			EACH DEVICE EG ROUTER

	2) 	CENTRAL DATABASE

			'MIB' MANAGEMENT INFO 'BASE

		TO COLLECT ALL STATS FROM OUR NETWORK

	3) 	MONITOR STATS

			ARE THEY ON???

				HEARTBEAT SENT EVERY 30 SECS
				FROM EACH CLIENT SO WE KNOW
				WHICH ONES ARE 'UP'

			DATA GOING THROUGH DEVICE EG

				RATE MBPS
				TOTAL MB   / HOUR

SMB SERVER MESSAGE BLOCK

	SHARES ARE CREATED USING SMB PROTOCOL

	CIFS IS UPGRADED SMB

```

WIFI

```
802.11 IS OFFICIAL NAME FOR WIFI

TWO MODES ON A NETWORK

1) AD-HOC 

	TWO LAPTOPS TALK DIRECTLY TO EACH OTHER
	
	

2) INFRASTRUCTURE

	WIFI POINT : ALL TRAFFIC GOES THROUGH THIS

	ENCRYPTION ENABLED AT ROUTER

	WEP	WIRED EQUIVALENT PRIVACY

		OLD
		HACKED
		
	WPA/2	

		WPA : ENCRYPTED BY TKIP
		WPA2 : ENCRYPTED BY AES (CURRENT)

		PERSONAL 

			WIFI KEY...				

		ENTERPRISE

			AUTHENTICATE USERS VIA A 'RADIUS'		
			SERVER

			802.1X ==> MACHINE-TO-MACHINE
			AUTHENTICATION (LAYER 2)

			 CLIENT -- WIFI -- RADIUS ---> ACTIVE
						      DIRECTORY

```

WIFI FREQUENCIES

```
		SPEED		FREQ
		Mbps		GHz

B		11		2.4

G		54		2.4

N		150+		2.4 and 5

	MIMO AERIAL : MULTIPLE INPUT MULTIPLE OUTPUT
		MORE AERIALS ==> FASTER SPEED

AC		433			5	

B,G,N ALL COMPATIBLE : WORK AT SLOWEST COMMON SPEED

CHANNELS 1-14 : DEFAULT 1 OR 6 OR 11

```

=============== not done =====================

PROXY

```
ALL WEB TRAFFIC GOES THROUGH THIS MACHINE

1) MONITOR WHICH USERS GOING ON WEB, FOR HOW LONG
2) BLACKLIST SITES
3) MONITOR DOWNLOADS
4) CACHE (STORE) WEBSITE DATA : FASTER FOR LOCAL USERS

DANGER : BOTTLENECK : MANAGE !!!

```

NAT

```
NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION

	((( PAT = PORT ADDRESS TRANSLATION ))

PROBLEM : PUBLIC IP ADDRESS COST MONEY

	$5-$10 PER MONTH PER IP

SOLUTION : HAVE ONE ONLY PUBLIC IP ADDRESS PER COMPANY

	ALL CLIENTS HAVE PRIVATE IP

	AT NAT ROUTER : PRIVATE IP SWAPPED OUT AND PUBLIC
			IP IS PUT INTO THE PACKETS

RESULT : INTERNAL COMPUTERS HAVE PRIVATE IP BUT CAN STILL
		ACCESS PUBLIC INTERNET	

	172.16.20.98  ==>  ROUTER : GETS SWAPPED FOR WHAT IP ???

```

DMZ = DE-MILITARIZED ZONE = PERIMITER NETWORK

NAC NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL

```
USED TO 

	1) AUTHENTICATE USERS (WHO WANT ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE)
			EG VPN

	2) ENSURE HEALTH OF MACHINES (CONNECTING FROM 
			OUTSIDE) EG VPN

		A) AV RUNNING, UP TO DATE
		B) FIREWALL
		C) AV SCAN - RECENT?
		D) ADWARE/SPYWARE SCAN?
		E) WINDOWS UP TO DATE?

<< WINDOWS : CALLED NAP NETWORK ACCESS PROTECTION >>

```

CLOUD AND INTERNET

```
LOCAL NETWORK : HIGH COSTS WITH BUYING LOTS OF HARDWARE
	EG CABLES, SERVERS, SWITCHES, ROUTERS, FIREWALLS,
	ELECTRICITY, COOLING, SECURE ROOMS

		BACKUP!!!

		SITE STAFF COSTS & TRAINING !!!

		SECURITY!!!

SOME COSTS BEST OFFLOADED TO REMOTE SITE FOR OTHERS TO 
	TAKE HEADACHE OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS

	COSTLY TO RUN IN CLOUD !!!

	BUT ADVANTAGES ARE : 

		DON'T NEED SPACE!
		DATA AVAILABLE GLOBALLY
		SECURE (ENCRYPTED)
		MAINTENANCE BY PROFESSIONALS
		BACKUP AUTOMATIC (ACROSS GLOBE)

PERMISSIONS

```
WINDOWS : PERMISSION SETTINGS CALLED 'NTFS'

			NT = NEW TECHNOLOGY (1995)
			FS = FILING SYSTEM

	ACL = ACCESS CONTROL LIST .. OF USERS
	ACE = ENTRY IN ACL   LIST .. OF PERMISSIONS

	NTFS PERMISSIONS

		FULL CONTROL    CAN SET PERMISSIONS

		MODIFY		CHANGE DATA (NOT PERMISSIONS)

		READ 		

		EXECUTE		RUN .EXE 

		WRITE		ADD BUT NOT MODIFY

		LIST/TRAVERSE FOLDERS  VIEW FOLDER

SHARE PERMISSIONS 

		WEAK; NOT USED MUCH FOR SECURITY

		FULL CONTROL
		CHANGE
		READ

	SHARE : UNC PATH TO REACH SHARE

		\\\\server_name\\share_name

		\\\\ip_address\\share_name

		server_name = HOSTNAME = NAME OF MACHINE

			1) MY COMPUTER => PROPERTIES
			2) HOSTNAME

			EG MY HOSTNAME IS .. 2301-377179

		FULL SHARE NAME IS \\\\2301-377179\\SHARE

		USING IP IT IS \\\\192.168.1.13\\SHARE

FILE ATTRIBUTES

```
EVERY FILE HAS SOME EXTRA 'TAGS' CALLED ATTRIBUTES

	- HIDDEN

		EXISTS BUT DOES NOT APPEAR NORMALLY

	- SYSTEM

		CRITICAL WINDOWS FILE

	- ARCHIVE

		0 ==> FILE HAS NOT CHANGED
		1 ==> FILE HAS CHANGED (BACKUP PROGRAM
			 WILL DETECT THIS AND STORE
				CHANGES)

	- READ ONLY

		

	- INDEX

		WINDOWS INDEXES FILE FOR FAST FINDING

ATTRIB COMMAND

	-H HIDDEN
	-S SYSTEM
	-A ARCHIVE
	-R READ ONLY

NOTE : /27 MEANS IN LAST OCTET 

	FIVE ZEROS FOR PCS

	QUESTION : HOW MANY COMPUTERS CAN WE FIT HERE???

	2 TO THE POWER 5 IS 32 (BUT SUBTRACT 2) 

MAGIC NUMBER : NETWORK JUMP WILL BE EVERY 32 PLACES
	FIRST NETWORK ....32
	SECOND           .64
            3RD               96
			  
	8TH               224  

	8 NETWORKS 

WORK THIS OUT BECAUSE 2 TO THE POWER 3 ==> 8

<http://jodies.de/ipcalc>

```

1111 0000
Questions : HOW MANY COMPUTERS PER NETWORK?? 2 TO THE POWER 4 = 16-2=14
WHAT THEN IS THE 'NETWORK BOUNCE' IE THE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS
OF THE ALLOWED NETWORKS? 0,16,32,64,96..
HOW MANY NETWORKS? 16 (2 TO POWER 4)
SECOND NETWORK ID? 16
SECOND NETWORK BROADCAST ADDRESS?

AUTHENTICATION

```
SOMETHING YOU ...

		KNOW (PASSWORD)
		HAVE (CARD)
		ARE  (BIOMETRIC)

```

SECURITY

```
TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
	
	EG CARD + USER/PASSWORD
	OR USER/PASS + IP VERIFICATION

TOKEN

	ELECTRONIC KEY ISSUED TO YOU ONCE AUTHENTICATED

KERBEROS

	ENCRYPTION AND SECURITY USED FOR ACTIVE DIRECTORY

MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION

	MACHINES : EG SERVER-SERVER

	802.1X : MACHINE-TO-MACHINE TRUST
	CERTIFICATES INSTALLED ON EACH MACHINE
		GENERATE LEVELS OF TRUST

	(CERTIFICATE : DIGITAL PASSPORT)

SSO

	SINGLE SIGN-ON

TKIP

	ENCRYPTION AT SAME TIME AS VISTA ==> WRONG ANSWER

EAP

	CURRENT ENCRYPTION STANDARD

	(( SHELL INSIDE WHICH OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS ))

	USE WITH WIRELESS LOGIN 

	USER=> AUTHENTICATE ==> WIFI ROUTER ==> CONNECTED
				TO 'RADIUS' ==> 
				         ACTIVE DIRECTORY

AES 

	CURRENT ENCRYPTION STANDARD

ENCRYPTION : GARBLING UP TEXT

TWO TYPES OF ENCRYPTION

	SHARED : SYMMETRIC KEY

	CLIENT ===> SEND DATA ==> KEY ABCDEFG TO ENCRYPT

		===> RECEIVE DATA ==> KEY ABCDEFG TO DECRYPT

		ONE KEY WHICH DOES THE 

			-ENCRYPTION

			-DECRYPTION			

		COMMON IN

			WIFI

			EFS ENCRYPTION IN WINDOWS
				(PASSWORD IS KEY)

			'SESSION' ONLINE (BANKING)
			  (SHORT TERM)

		INHERENTLY INSECURE BECAUSE ONE KEY 
			DOING BOTH THINGS (ENCRYPT/DECRYPT)	

		EXAM : WEP OLD
		       WPA NEW GOOD

	PKI PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY PAIR	

		TWO KEYS 
			ONE : ENCRYPT
			OTHER : DECRYPT

		VERY SECURE : USED IN ALL BUSINESS TODAY

	CERTIFICATE

		DIGITAL KEY ISSUED TO USER / COMPUTER

		IT IS THE 'PUBLIC' HALF OF KEY PAIR

	SIGNING

		FILE MYWORK.DOC

			1. CREATE A HASH FROM THE FILE

			2. ENCYRYPT THIS HASH USING OUR PRIVATE KEY

			COURT OF LAW : USE PUBLIC KEY TO DECRYPT HASH
				AND VERIFY INTEGRITY OF ORIGINAL FILE
				(RE-TAKE HASH AND CHECK OLD AND NEW HASHES 
				MATCH)

		SECURE BOOT	UEFI : FIRMWARE OF COMPUTER GETS 'SIGNED' AND
				KEYS STORED INSIDE 'TPM' CHIP

				BOOT COMPUTER ==> BOOT FILE INTEGRITY IS VALIDATES

					STOP  ROOTKIT INFECTION

		CREDENTIAL GUARD   : STORE CREDENTIALS IN SECURE 'VIRTUAL VALULT'
		DEVICE GUARD	   : APPS MUST BE SIGNED
		X64 		     DRIVERS MUST BE SIGNED
			
		

	WEB ENCRYPTION

		SSL ENCRYPT WEB TRANSACTIONS

		TLS : REPLACED SSL

		RELY ON CERTIFICATE ISSUED TO WEBSITE IN 
					ADVANCE

HASHING

	ONE-WAY ENCRYPTION

	TEXT STRING   ==> ALGORIGTHM ==>   ZK3FLKJPOIDFCFLKJ

	1) ONE-WAY : MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN YOU CAN'T REVERSE
		GET BACK TO ORIGINAL TEXT	

	2) HASHES ALL SAME LENGTH

	
	3) CHANGE ONE CHARACTER : HASH CHANGE UNRECOGNISABLY

TWO WAYS TODAY TO PRODUCE HASHES

	1) MD5  (older)

		MD5HASHGENERATOR.COM

	2) SHA1  (CURRENT, GOVERNMENT APPROVED EG US GOV)

	POWER OF HASHING IS WHAT???

	1) PASSWORDS : NEVER STORE A REAL PASSWORD - ONLY 
		STORE HASH OF ALL PASSWORDS IN DATABASE

			MYFAVPASSWORD ==> HASH AND STORE XLJASDFSA;LKJFDAS
```
